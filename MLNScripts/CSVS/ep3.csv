"00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,209",2.085,Then why isn't he eating?
"00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,235",1.543,Just leave him.
"00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,487",2.168,Why do you keep bothering him?

"00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,386",1.794,Where should we go? A bar?
"00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,224",1.460,It looks delicious.
"00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,686",2.503,"So tell me, why don't you want to go home?"
"00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:02,730",0.959,Just because.

"00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,442",1.960,You always dodge questions like that.

"00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,904",1.043,just tell us.
"00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,410",1.877,There's this guy
"00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,038",2.335,that eats at my house. And it's uncomfortable.

"00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,384",1.168,I really don't know.
"00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,595",1.377,I don't even know his name.
"00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,889",1.835,"I don't even know his name,"
"00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,309",1.544,yet I made a huge mistake.
"00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,893",1.501,So what kind of mistake?
"00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:49,277",3.962,Spill it already! Spill! Now!
"00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,825",1.835,"You lent a guy money, didn't you?"
"00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,664",1.835,Guys can be sly as a fox too.
"00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,795",4.170,"He saw that you're the kind of woman he could borrow money from, screw over,"
"00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,590",1.210,and get away with it.
"00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:18,473",2.836,So stop avoiding it and deal with the problem at hand.
"00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,812",2.002,"Once that jerk's paid all the money back,"
"00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,732",1.502,will my life be fine?
"00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,234",1.751,I think it will still be the same.
"00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,073",1.669,I'll still have never felt whole
"00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,450",2.294,in this crappy life with these crappy people
"00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,952",1.501,acting like they're so great
"00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,747",1.794,and just talking away thoughtlessly.
"00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,625",1.001,How they talk…
"00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:56,427",1.001,Sorry.
"00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,681",1.460,"I'm an asshole, too."

"00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,827",1.001,What?
"00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,373",2.503,I really don't want to go home.
"00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,625",0.834,Hey.
"00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,585",1.209,Just miss the last train.

"00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,226",1.001,Idiot.
"00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,937",1.793,All he ever does is drink every day.
"00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,860",3.796,"Do you want to win by cheating your friend like that, asshole?"
"00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:54,944",1.001,Whatever.
"00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,780",2.169,-That's your problem. -Hey.
"00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:48,975",0.876,Mom.
"00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,187",3.045,"Please, let's turn the air-conditioner on. Please?"
"00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,484",2.586,Mother. I beg you.
"00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,897",2.711,Why has he turned his back against the world?
"00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,029",2.628,<i>The number you have dialed cannot be--</i>
"00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,451",2.461,I MADE THIS MONTH'S PAYMENT. CALL ME.
"00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,662",2.128,THIS MESSAGE WAS DELETED
"00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,771",1.960,She asked if anything's up with you.
"00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:00,773",1.460,What's going on?
"00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,903",2.377,"I got called to the Joy Support Center,"
"00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,824",2.336,and I cried because I didn't want to join a club.
"00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:11,534",1.210,Goodness.
"00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,369",1.752,Just join anything
"00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,080",2.628,and say you're too busy to attend. That'll do it.
"00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,335",1.877,She's too straitlaced.
"00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,511",2.169,How about joining the photography club with me?
"00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:33,305",2.210,"No one drinks, and everyone's really nice."
"00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:37,810",3.086,It must be annoying to keep being called in over such a thing.
"00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,397",1.585,I want to stop learning things.

"00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,994",1.502,School was the same.
"00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:59,457",3.879,"I hadn't learnt the multiplication table, but we still had to move on to fractions."
"00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:04,837",3.795,"After that, I was just sitting there."
"00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,177",2.503,"In a club, the same thing will just happen again."
"00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,096",1.835,"Besides, nothing's fun for me."
"00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,349",2.419,I shouldn't have told you
"00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,019",2.086,about Su-jin and the others going on a trip.
"00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,857",1.919,You think I'd have fun on a trip?

"00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,927",2.211,<i>It's just this one month I couldn't pay.</i>
"00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:56,180",2.336,<i>I'm racking my brain now for a solution.</i>
"00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,850",3.587,"<i>But if you call Se-yeong, you can forget about the money.</i>"

"00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,691",1.584,Crazy bastard.

"00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,315",2.252,"After saying I'm ""unbearably and disgustingly old-fashioned,"""
"00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,067",1.669,she wants us to be friends.
"00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,194",2.044,Is she insane? Does she think I'm an idiot?
"00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,071",0.835,Sorry.
"00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,407",1.960,"She said she and that guy weren't a thing,"
"00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,701",2.210,and they picked up two more people right after.
"00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,954",3.169,What does that have to do with me? Why did she even tell me that?
"00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,792",3.754,"If it's over, just let it be over. That's normal."
"00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,168",1.293,But her being friendly…
"00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,380",1.752,End things beautifully?
"00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:42,591",3.128,Don't make me laugh. There's no such thing as a beautiful breakup.
"00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,511",1.710,Then she took it out on me
"00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:46,887",1.293,<i>saying I embarrassed her</i>
"00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,389",1.419,<i>-in front of others.</i> -Asshole.
"00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,528",2.378,Can't they just get married without other people?
"00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:06,365",2.961,"In the past, people went to weddings to eat food since they were poor."
"00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,242",1.794,But they all eat well now.
"00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:10,994",1.167,"Hey, I'm hungry."
"00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,632",1.585,So you live in Uijeongbu?
"00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,259",0.918,Yes.
"00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:31,140",4.213,Then this is a meeting between North Gyeonggi-do and South Gyeonggi-do.
"00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:35,561",3.629,We have penetrated the egg yolk to meet.
"00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,109",3.170,Oh. That's what my brother says.
"00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:45,487",3.295,"That Gyeonggi-do is like the egg white wrapped around Seoul,"
"00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,406",1.835,which is the egg yolk.
"00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:52,578",3.546,So we've both come into the yolk to meet.
"00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:56,957",1.168,That's funny.
"00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,046",3.795,"Does it take you about an hour and a half to get to Seoul from there, too?"
"00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,715",0.960,Yes.
"00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,342",1.877,"Right, me too."
"00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,013",2.378,A round trip of three hours for both of us.
"00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,891",1.752,We might as well go on a trip.
"00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,561",1.752,Isn't the commute pretty bad?
"00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,604",0.960,It's the worst.
"00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,690",2.502,Are you managing?
"00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,275",0.834,Not really.
"00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:26,278",2.461,I feel like my batteries are going to run out soon.
"00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,113",1.001,Same here.
"00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,157",1.460,So I should decide soon
"00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,743",1.877,whether to change jobs or move to Seoul.
"00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:36,914",3.170,I'd decide to move to Seoul.
"00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:40,959",2.127,You haven't let go of that dream yet?
"00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,629",1.836,Have you let go?
"00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:48,467",4.046,"It's still too early to give up just yet, so hold on a little longer."
"00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,939",4.797,"You were saved in Jeong-su's phone as ""Pick-up Girl."""
"00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,523",0.917,What does that mean?
"00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,277",1.376,"Oh, that?"
"00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,863",1.710,"""A girl who always picks up the phone""?"
"00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:12,616",2.669,"I asked him, but he said it wasn't that"
"00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,868",2.169,and told me to ask you directly.
"00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,245",0.835,What does it mean?
"00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:18,538",1.001,This again.
"00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,125",2.711,"I'm tearing up, just thinking about it."
"00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,756",2.252,"Once, with my friends,"
"00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:32,844",4.296,"we were talking about ""What's the noblest romance there is?"""
"00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:36,181",3.253,"And I was reminded of something I saw in a history book at school,"
"00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:42,980",6.715,about a woman who ran to pick up the severed head of her husband in her skirt.
"00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,524",2.461,"When I was young, it was too gruesome for me,"
"00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,985",2.378,"but now that I'm older, I think,"
"00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:51,780",3.712,"""Yes, I would pick it up, no, I'd have to pick it up."""
"00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,492",3.629,"""I can't let it fall to the ground. I should run and catch it in my skirt."""
"00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:56,910",0.834,Yes.
"00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,370",1.376,Don't you think so?
"00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,038",1.585,Isn't that only right?
"00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:04,167",4.045,"And one summer, ages ago, I spent a short time at Bible Camp."
"00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,129",2.878,"I heard the story of how Jesus was nailed to the cross,"
"00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,424",3.212,"but weirdly, it was Mary that my heart went out to."
"00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:12,926",2.419,It took about six hours for Jesus to die
"00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,470",2.460,after getting whipped and nailed to the cross.
"00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,141",3.587,"For those six hours, Mary followed the entire way"
"00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,977",2.753,and took Jesus's body down.
"00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,730",1.001,She's amazing.
"00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:28,233",2.127,"I should stay by my partner's side, too."
"00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:58,180",2.127,<i>Why would you talk about that?</i>
"00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,561",4.129,They'd be too scared about being beheaded to fall for you.
"00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,147",1.585,You need to watch what you say.
"00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,107",1.877,Why would you say that to someone you just met?
"00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,860",1.293,"Well, he asked."
"00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,903",0.960,So what?
"00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:16,156",3.170,Would you tell him how your poop was this morning if he asked?
"00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,574",1.335,"Yes, I'd tell him everything."
"00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,286",1.752,Just live alone.
"00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,789",2.419,Why are you trying so hard to love just anyone?
"00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:27,042",2.461,Don't do it. No one will love you.
"00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,002",1.877,No man would fall in love with a woman
"00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,421",2.335,who says she'd pick up their lover's severed head.
"00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:36,593",3.670,"I just mean, if such a thing happens. Hypothetically."
"00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:39,554",2.878,"Exactly, why are you imagining that situation?"
"00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,266",3.628,We don't want to be beheaded. We don't want to imagine that.
"00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,020",3.170,Why did you have to give him such a gruesome example?
"00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,941",2.670,That's the noblest romance? We're not living in that era.
"00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:58,824",3.087,"She's not looking for a boyfriend, she's looking for a comrade-in-arms."
"00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:02,160",3.253,You must feel so much regret that you were born in such peaceful times.
"00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:07,124",4.880,You must want to charge at enemies and risk your life to save the country.
"00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,167",1.960,So sitting and eating dinner with a guy
"00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,254",3.003,"must be terribly dull and unsatisfying for you, right?"
"00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,595",0.834,"All right, then."
"00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,223",1.460,One. Women who run away.
"00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:24,683",1.377,Two. Women who faint.
"00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:27,602",2.836,Three. Women who pick it up. Which woman do you want?
"00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,526",3.337,Which one would you prefer out of the three?
"00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,695",2.086,"Hey, which woman are you?"
"00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,284",2.002,I'd pick it up too if it came to that.
"00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:44,286",1.293,She's a pick-up girl.
"00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,415",4.046,Girls who flirt and act all feminine like Lee Ye-rin would never pick it up.
"00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:50,417",1.919,Those kinds of girls would run away.
"00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,294",1.293,Is that love?
"00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:58,175",3.671,So you're saying that your man should be beheaded.
"00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,135",0.876,"Hey, Du-hwan."
"00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,928",1.168,We need to start a war.
"00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:04,347",2.335,Gi-jeong's man absolutely must be beheaded.
"00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,434",1.210,As long as it's not me.
"00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:08,894",0.876,Oh Du-hwan.
"00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,522",3.003,Your name could start a war. Oh Du-hwan.
"00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,109",2.878,Yeom Chang-hee. Your name's just as bad.
"00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,238",1.960,"Mi-jeong, go buy some more alcohol."
"00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:23,742",0.834,No.
"00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:25,702",0.834,No?
"00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,705",1.501,Then go borrow some from Gu.
"00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,168",1.502,Just go borrow some already.
"00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,671",2.460,You bring him food every day. I'm sure he'll give us some.
"00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,840",2.085,Hurry. You and Mr. Gu are close.
"00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,344",1.126,As if.
"00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,554",1.251,Let's just call it a night.
"00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,765",2.127,We're short by just one drink. Hurry up and go.
"00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:51,144",1.918,There's no alcohol at Mr. Gu's place. So enough.
"00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:53,563",1.835,Why wouldn't there be when he's a drunk?
"00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:57,067",2.670,Alcoholics never have alcohol stored away.
"00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,027",1.877,They just keep two to three bottles.
"00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:02,239",2.711,"At first, he thinks, ""Just two bottles today."""
"00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,534",2.795,"""I'll just drink two bottles."" And he only buys two bottles."
"00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,370",2.753,"Once he finishes them, he just wants more."
"00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,331",2.878,So he goes all the way to the train station to buy more.
"00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,292",2.460,It would have been better if he had started off with four bottles.
"00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,877",1.501,But it's always two.
"00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,755",2.127,That's how hard it is to be an alcoholic.
"00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:22,092",1.335,You two must be close.
"00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:24,469",1.376,We're next-door neighbors.
"00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,514",1.210,Have you guys even talked?
"00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:30,892",0.834,Once.
"00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,688",1.043,"So, while drinking,"
"00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,357",2.044,he always goes in and brings out a new glass.
"00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:41,778",3.170,He always has two or three shot glasses on the table.
"00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:44,030",1.334,"So I asked him why,"
"00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,325",2.794,and he said he changes glasses when he gets bored.
"00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,499",2.544,"What a poor, lonely guy."
"00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,253",2.711,I thought he was really cool.
"00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:00,463",0.875,Right.
"00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,632",1.293,"See, during the day,"
"00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,219",2.669,he drinks one glass looking at the window on this side.
"00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:11,808",4.004,"When the sun sets, he drinks one glass looking at the porch over there."
"00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,394",0.834,"At night,"
"00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,231",2.878,he drinks one glass looking at the other window.
"00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,068",2.252,He only changes the direction
"00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,946",2.294,staying still like this.
"00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:30,118",3.003,It's as if he's standing guard. Like a neighborhood watch.
"00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,542",1.835,"Hey, he's not out there today, though."
"00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,172",3.045,Come on. It's too hot and humid.
"00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,216",2.961,"There's no breeze, either. He's probably inside with the AC on."
"00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,388",1.626,Let's call it a night.
"00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,390",1.209,Bring those with you.
"00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,019",1.210,Should I go over?
"00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:28,228",2.085,This wall is perfect for catching mosquitoes.
"00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,731",2.002,You can see everything. It's so clean.
"00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:34,693",2.502,"If a mosquito gets into my room, I can never find it."
"00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,071",2.294,"The wallpaper's a mess, everything's a mess."
"00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:41,533",1.376,How many bottles have you had?
"00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:48,874",3.170,I have the feeling that's the second.
"00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:55,130",4.254,I came because I thought it might be more fun to have a drinking buddy
"00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,965",1.751,than change glasses.
"00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,013",1.543,Can I join you?
"00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,767",1.377,Where's a glass?
"00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:15,984",1.167,HANJO BANK

"00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:40,676",1.585,No way.
"00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,260",1.752,YSTAT RESEARCH
"00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,348",2.044,"Everything else is almost done,"
"00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:11,850",2.419,but we don't have enough single men in their 40s from Gangwon-do.
"00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:15,062",2.628,We won't make it up with cold calling by 6 p.m.
"00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:16,355",1.210,We should widen the limit.
"00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,358",2.378,Let's try for a bit longer. There's still time.
"00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:23,278",3.837,But it's a long shot. We haven't gotten anyone in the past two hours.
"00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,199",1.919,Let's just widen the limit.
"00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:29,993",1.084,Then…
"00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:32,120",1.251,how about until eight?
"00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,206",1.377,Let's try until eight o'clock.
"00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,515",1.418,Working overtime again today?
"00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,809",1.710,He's making us every day.
"00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:57,729",2.878,That's why he gives out those lottery tickets so often.
"00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,068",3.045,"By the way, how did your blind date go?"
"00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,197",1.001,You know…
"00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,700",1.794,We agreed to meet again next time.
"00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,371",2.961,"Doesn't ""next time"" usually mean ""never""?"
"00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,794",1.043,"I was wondering,"
"00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,255",1.627,did you get your chompers done?
"00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,758",2.169,It's just that they look so straight.
"00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:32,723",2.920,"Don't you usually use the word ""chompers"" with animals?"
"00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:37,352",3.837,"For people, we say ""teeth."""
"00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:49,990",1.752,You can use the word chompers on people too.
"00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:54,703",4.046,"You can say chompers, teeth, or gnashers. Right?"
"00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,372",1.960,We can use any of them. What's with her?
"00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:18,894",2.628,Hey. Are you on your way home?
"00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:20,687",0.834,Yes.
"00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,106",1.168,Good job today.
"00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,816",1.126,"You too, Mr. Park."
"00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,626",2.044,Can I ask you a question?
"00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:43,960",0.834,Sure.
"00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:52,636",4.254,How many of those lottery tickets have you given out to women?
"00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,014",1.209,I'm sure it's quite a lot.
"00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,016",1.418,And not just to women.
"00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:03,397",3.295,Do you know you've never once given one to me?
"00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,740",1.001,No way.
"00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,742",1.918,Not even once.
"00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,455",1.752,"Hold on, wait."
"00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:22,207",0.834,Well…
"00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,085",2.127,"I'm sorry, that shocked me quite a bit."
"00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,505",2.294,I should have been more subtle.
"00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:31,425",0.960,I'm embarrassed.
"00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:34,636",2.044,-I'm so sorry. -No.
"00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:49,943",0.959,"You know,"
"00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:53,530",3.003,I've decided to love someone this winter. Just anyone.
"00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:56,950",1.793,Don't be nervous.
"00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:04,166",3.045,"I've been so impatient lately, I just want to die already."
"00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,710",1.669,"After 14 years, my job is the same,"
"00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:09,087",2.294,"the meetings are the same, and the people are the same,"
"00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:12,841",3.253,I curse and get mad the same way. It's all the same endless repetition.
"00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,302",1.752,"""Will it be this way until I die?"""
"00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,430",2.628,"""Let's not live like this anymore. Let's just love anyone."""
"00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:21,516",3.003,"""Even a relationship I force myself into could turn into love."""
"00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,978",3.378,"""I'll love him passionately. I'll make him my whole world."""
"00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,064",0.834,But…
"00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:30,108",1.543,no one comes near me.
"00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,861",2.127,"Everyone skips over me, like you."
"00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:35,822",1.334,"Well, that was…"
"00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:38,158",1.126,A subconscious decision?
"00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,745",2.336,I want to know why it was that you did that.
"00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,331",1.961,Why does everybody skip over me?
"00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,959",3.044,I'm willing to hear whatever you have to say
"00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:50,795",2.752,even if it shatters my pride.
"00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,464",1.168,Why do you think that is?
"00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,425",1.126,Well…
"00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:59,804",3.753,"First of all, from my perspective,"
"00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,308",2.461,the type of woman a man likes never changes.
"00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:07,896",4.004,"Whenever my friends introduce me to their new girlfriends,"
"00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:10,440",2.461,I find that they date people who are just like their exes.
"00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,234",1.293,Men's tastes don't change.
"00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:18,281",4.629,"In general, comedians marry comedians, and actors marry actors, right?"
"00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,785",2.252,"-Well, that's who they see the most. -No."
"00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,370",1.502,That's not the reason.
"00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:25,580",2.127,It's because they're attracted to those types.
"00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:29,543",3.170,It's whether you prefer someone who makes you laugh
"00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,003",2.377,or someone who makes your heart flutter.
"00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:33,588",0.917,I prefer the latter.
"00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,632",1.168,I prefer the latter too.
"00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,725",3.628,People who have a lot of dating experience know what they want.
"00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,352",1.543,"But those who don't,"
"00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:50,814",3.379,don't know what they want or what type of person they are.
"00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:54,401",3.504,They just want passionate romance because that's what they hear people want.
"00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,194",1.710,"But when they finally have it,"
"00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:59,364",3.086,many find it too embarrassing and can't stand it.
"00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,825",1.794,"It can be embarrassing, but I like it."
"00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:05,870",3.962,"When you're embarrassed about something, it means you find it uncomfortable."
"00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,373",1.126,So…
"00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:15,255",4.713,"You might be very natural and charming in a different genre, Ms. Yeom."
"00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:18,049",2.711,"Melodrama isn't the only genre of relationships, right?"
"00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,052",2.502,"There's comedy, surrealism,"
"00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,763",2.043,"thriller… Yes, that's a good one."
"00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,850",3.003,"What else, slice-of-life? Suspense? There are so many."
"00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:32,480",5.046,In which genre among those do you think you'd be most effective?
"00:39:40,322 --> 00:39:41,781",1.459,What are your strengths?
"00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:50,999",2.211,I'm like a Jindo dog.
"00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,961",3.170,I stand by my man and never betray him. I protect him.
"00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,255",2.210,And my man must be a real man.
"00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,716",2.377,But I don't mean he has to be all big and burly.
"00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:04,054",2.503,"Yes, I have my own idea of masculinity."
"00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,138",1.001,"A man, yes."
"00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:07,265",1.293,Slice-of-life it is. Yes.
"00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,726",1.668,"It almost veered toward thriller,"
"00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,478",1.669,but you're the slice-of-life type.
"00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:14,856",3.295,Many are not really interested in surprise events or grand gestures.
"00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:17,817",2.878,The most important thing to them is their attitude toward life.
"00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,277",1.376,They look at a person's core.
"00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:22,864",1.001,The core.
"00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:24,658",0.876,Attitude.
"00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,287",3.628,"Anyway, if you keep that in mind, you'll usually make the right choice."
"00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:34,709",4.296,"And rather than being recklessly determined to love just anyone,"
"00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:39,464",4.087,deciding to go for it when you meet someone you like
"00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:40,924",1.377,will be far more constructive.
"00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,933",3.462,You really are an expert.
"00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:51,559",0.834,Okay.
"00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,064",4.004,"If I meet a man I like, I'm going to try to make the first move."
"00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:57,857",1.209,"Not just the first move,"
"00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,567",1.167,but the first confession.
"00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:04,447",2.502,That's so embarrassing though.
"00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,907",1.376,"My mom always says,"
"00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,577",3.587,"""A house and spouse will come to you when the time is right."""
"00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,122",2.461,You'll find one when the time is right.
"00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,457",1.668,-Will he? -He will.
"00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:17,502",1.043,Okay.
"00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:23,091",3.504,I feel like I need to give you a fortune-teller's fee or something.
"00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,175",1.001,No.
"00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:39,691",2.753,"If I go this way, I can get home faster."
"00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,484",1.084,Get home safe.
"00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:44,738",2.670,You must really not be interested in me at all.
"00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,573",1.752,You can't wait to go home.
"00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,285",2.127,"No, I'm just kidding."
"00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,620",2.252,"-Let's go together. -No, go ahead."
"00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:54,497",1.793,-It's fine. Go ahead. -All right.
"00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:58,084",3.503,"-See you tomorrow. -Go on, off you go. Go ahead. Go."
"00:41:58,835 --> 00:41:59,753",0.918,See you tomorrow.
"00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:33,953",4.588,SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY
"00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,624",1.877,"Something good, my foot."
"00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,117",1.126,I'm going to go.
"00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:16,788",2.336,"Hey, use the restroom before you go."
"00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:19,290",0.834,I'm fine.
"00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:22,126",2.252,Do as I say. It's a long way back to Seoul.
"00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,170",1.960,I just wanted to try coming here once.
"00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,175",1.418,I came here for a change!
"00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:31,594",1.835,"To your neighborhood, Dangmi Station!"
"00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:34,597",1.293,It's nothing special.
"00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,285",2.586,"Even if you need to pee, hold it. This is the last train."
"00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:57,412",2.044,Hold it until you get to Seoul.
"00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,003",1.001,I'm home.
"00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:48,671",1.585,Mom and Dad aren't here.
"00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:50,340",1.168,Where are they?
"00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,507",1.084,At a funeral.
"00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:53,593",1.210,Who passed away?
"00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:54,969",0.876,Mom's uncle.
"00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,818",3.128,Why are you acting like you got dumped when it was you who dumped her?
"00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,821",1.001,What do you mean?
"00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,367",2.044,Lee Ye-rin. You're the one who dumped her.
"00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:22,288",2.336,Watching the movie and going to the restaurant alone
"00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,165",1.793,when you promised to go together.
"00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:27,168",2.461,Who wouldn't break up after that?
"00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:34,258",2.460,He always does something that'll get him dumped.
"00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:36,344",2.002,He totally deserves it.
"00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:37,887",1.460,Do you have another girl?
"00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,557",3.587,Did you want to break up with her because you met someone else you liked?
"00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:46,646",2.419,-Do you think I'd do that? -Then why did you do it?
"00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:50,274",2.961,Lee Ye-rin went home after crying for a while at Dangmi Station.
"00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,155",1.918,I guess she knows she messed up.
"00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,074",1.835,You're the one who messed up.
"00:45:58,157 --> 00:46:00,034",1.877,She started it!
"00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:01,828",1.710,I saw that look in her eyes.
"00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:05,206",3.295,"The look in her eyes that says, ""This guy's nothing special."""
"00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:08,000",2.711,The look I've seen in their eyes many times.

"00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:16,342",2.461,"At first, I do as they say and play along."
