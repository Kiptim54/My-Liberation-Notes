"00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,516",2.210,I did go to a salon to fix it a little.

"00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,433",1.460,And he asked me if he could see
"00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,560",1.001,what we wrote.
"00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,898",2.378,The liberation notes of all four of us.
"00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,275",1.210,He wants to publish them.

"00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,990",2.294,He said how we came together would make a great story.
"00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,075",2.002,He said it's going to be something.
"00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,494",2.335,"I have no idea what that something is,"
"00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,122",2.544,but he was talking to me with his eyes all sparkling.
"00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,707",1.501,It made me excited.
"00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,960",2.335,He says it could be a slice-of-life story
"00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,879",1.835,about ordinary office workers.
"00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,256",1.752,"Apparently, it's a great subject."

"00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:09,309",2.836,But it's not my decision to make on my own.
"00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,646",2.711,"So, I told him I would ask you all in person."
"00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,483",3.253,"Even today, he wanted to come here with me so I had to stop him."

"00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,707",1.835,and it's too personal…

"00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,968",2.670,Let's make pseudonyms.
"00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,265",2.294,I've also stopped halfway.
"00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:51,768",2.753,Wouldn't it still be quite a lot if we gathered all of ours?

"00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,441",2.294,I kept writing even after we stopped the club.
"00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,151",1.626,That's impressive.
"00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:03,530",2.336,"What about you, Mi-jeong? Do you still write?"
"00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,492",2.753,"No, I was done after I had finished one notebook."

"00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,962",3.670,But I'm not sure if it's good enough to be published as a book--
"00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,173",3.128,He says it is! Just the story from the four of us is…
"00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,344",0.959,I'm sorry.
"00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,265",3.045,I shouldn't have told him without asking you guys first.
"00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,767",1.668,I shouldn't act like this at my age.
"00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,729",1.752,"I told him about all of you,"
"00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,398",2.586,and about the things you wanted to be liberated from.
"00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:42,193",2.961,He liked it. He said it has weight.

"00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:08,970",2.377,I don't even know where my notebook is now.
"00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:13,600",3.337,"I was moved by the word ""liberation,"""

"00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:29,366",3.504,then I went back to living the way I used to.

"00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:06,528",3.087,"we can't exactly say we accomplished nothing, don't you think?"
"00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,365",2.336,Do you feel a little liberated?
"00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:15,036",2.878,"Well, some days, I feel like I am."

"00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:21,710",3.546,But I still feel I've been liberated even just a little.
"00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,089",2.795,"Do you not feel like that at all, Mr. Cho?"

"00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,361",3.211,I think that's what this is all about.

"00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,585",1.376,See? It's a flush.
"00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,423",2.460,A flush? I knew it.
"00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,390",1.669,-I feel bad for you. -Damn it.
"00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,243",1.460,You kept telling me to come back

"00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,539",2.086,It was because you needed money to gamble.

"00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:05,266",2.753,You're out if it drops below that even once.
"00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:18,112",2.377,And why do I have to remember my number?
"00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,426",1.376,Aren't you going to answer?
"00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:42,887",1.001,Sir?

"00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:47,220",3.838,You said you suddenly felt so lovable.
"00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,895",2.211,I wonder what it's like
"00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:58,731",1.335,to feel lovable.
"00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,534",0.960,See you again.
"00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,576",0.959,Take care.
"00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:29,637",1.001,My gosh.
"00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:33,891",1.460,"So you can joke around, too."
"00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,395",1.961,"I thought my hands would get shaky first,"
"00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,690",1.794,but I'm hearing things instead.
"00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,944",1.835,"Well, my brain must be breaking down."
"00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:20,825",3.629,I deserve it. Since I drink as soon as I open my eyes in the morning.
"00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,996",2.503,Not a lot of people start drinking in the morning.
"00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,999",2.920,They say even heavy drinkers can't drink in the morning.
"00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,670",2.461,But it's easier than being sober.
"00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,758",1.918,Why is it hard to stay sober?
"00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,182",1.459,"When I'm sober,"
"00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,688",2.294,all the people from my past come to me.
"00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:53,399",1.126,All of them.
"00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,569",1.168,Even the dead.
"00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,784",1.418,"When I wake up in the morning,"
"00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:07,163",1.794,the ones who were resting…
"00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,042",1.585,get up one by one
"00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,377",1.001,and come to me.
"00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,671",1.460,One by one.
"00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,007",0.959,Endlessly…
"00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,677",1.543,The ones who come for me…
"00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:24,555",1.960,I destroy them all inside my head.
"00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,766",1.502,And curse at them.
"00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,353",1.627,After I sit there
"00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:32,813",1.251,"for an hour doing that,"
"00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,192",1.210,I get exhausted.
"00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:40,279",1.084,It feels like…
"00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,575",2.127,there's sewage waste flowing inside my body.
"00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,705",1.543,"I say, ""Let's get up."""
"00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:51,832",0.917,"""Let's drink."""
"00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,087",3.421,"""They'll all go away if I drink."""
"00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:00,466",1.210,That's why
"00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,302",2.085,I'm more generous drunk
"00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:07,014",2.753,than I am when sober.
"00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,356",1.794,"Among those people who came for you,"
"00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,900",1.293,was I one of them?
"00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,211",1.001,What's wrong with me?
"00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:43,384",4.338,"I'm not even an alcoholic, but I understand you perfectly."
"00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:50,015",4.170,"When I'm brushing my teeth in the morning after a good sleep,"
"00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,853",3.754,"Choi Jun-ho, that asshole, is waiting for me in my head."
"00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,356",2.794,"Han Su-jin, that bitch, is there too."
"00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,484",2.210,"And that bastard, Jung Chan-hyeok, too."
"00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,989",1.669,All I did was sleep and wake up.
"00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:09,493",3.628,But I get angry while brushing my teeth.
"00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,624",1.710,What's that bastard's phone number?
"00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,628",2.168,Just give me the number. I'll take care of it.
"00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,176",1.627,That bastard…
"00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,596",2.002,shouldn't pay me back.
"00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:33,684",3.003,Because I want to prove what a terrible person he is
"00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,562",2.252,for as long as possible.
"00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,190",2.086,I want to prove to the world
"00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,528",3.795,"that he didn't leave me because I was small and insignificant,"
"00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,489",1.877,but because he was a terrible person.
"00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,241",1.751,That's why he left me like that.
"00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,328",1.877,I wanted to make him think
"00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,040",2.670,that he was a terrible person during his wedding.
"00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,627",2.878,"And if he ever has a child, I want to go to their birthday party"
"00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:04,798",4.546,and remind him again that he's a terrible person.
"00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,976",1.126,That's why
"00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,647",1.710,I'm always exhausted.
"00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:27,530",3.462,Since I decided to be someone who exists only to prove…
"00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,702",1.793,how terrible someone is.
"00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,670",3.754,Among those people you wanted to prove were terrible…
"00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:48,342",1.210,was I one of them?
"00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,767",1.418,You're like…
"00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,023",2.002,a sanctuary that I keep within my head.
"00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,485",2.836,Because I decided to keep you away from my hate.
"00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,031",1.751,"After you left,"
"00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,034",1.960,"my mom passed away,"
"00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,203",1.501,and my dad remarried…
"00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:19,873",1.042,I felt like
"00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,252",2.169,I was constantly being abandoned.
"00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:29,383",3.629,"In every kind of relationship I've had, I've never walked away first."
"00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:31,260",1.794,The other person always left me.
"00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:36,056",2.544,So I thought maybe something was wrong with me.
"00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,852",2.753,"And since it was so painful to find a problem with myself,"
"00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,771",2.377,I made myself believe everyone else was the asshole.
"00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:46,317",1.293,But I was
"00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,445",2.044,determined from the moment I met you.
"00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,658",3.628,that I wouldn't make any more assholes in my life.
"00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,039",4.130,That I'd gladly let you fly away if you become a better person.
"00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:03,709",2.961,That I wouldn't be embarrassed even if you hit rock bottom.
"00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:07,963",3.545,That I'd only cheer you on from one person to another.
"00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:12,843",3.629,"When I felt like I would hate you, I begged in my head,"
"00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:16,263",2.336,"""Please, don't even let him catch a cold."""
"00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:21,602",4.421,"""Please don't let him suffer from a hangover."""
"00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,983",1.793,"But since I was unhappy all the time,"
"00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,904",3.003,"when I wanted to blame you out of anger,"
"00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,156",2.169,"I would say, ""Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."""
"00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,328",1.877,Whenever nothing was going my way
"00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,997",2.586,"and I didn't know where to vent my anger,"
"00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:45,876",2.669,"I said, ""Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."""
"00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,340",1.502,"Then it occurred to me,"
"00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,343",2.044,"""What if he pays it all back?"""
"00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,721",1.710,"""Who would I curse, then?"""
"00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,894",1.919,I'm worried he might pay me back.
"00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,236",1.210,Come to think of it…
"00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,200",1.919,I've never caught a cold.
"00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:47,020",3.586,"Everyone, run backwards and wave your arms and say, ""Welcome!"""
"00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,189",2.085,-Welcome! -Welcome!
"00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,318",0.959,Face front again!
"00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,615",1.293,See you later!
"00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,535",1.251,"Hurry it up, okay?"
"00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,330",3.211,We've got all kinds of pork. It's an all-you-can-eat pork buffet!
"00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:27,102",2.127,It sure is different.
"00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:31,190",3.337,Mi-jeong went to the store early in the morning to get freshly made ones.
"00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,691",1.418,"Yes, you can tell."
"00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,652",1.918,Do you like the matching shirts?
"00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,367",2.836,That kimchi isn't good. Don't eat it.
"00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:44,703",2.252,There's amazing kimchi in the fridge.
"00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,502",1.377,Why did you get your hair cut
"00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,254",1.668,in the middle of winter?
"00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:59,426",2.044,I had it cut since it was too hard to wash it.
"00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,512",2.002,It feels so light now that it's short.
"00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,763",1.168,Goodness me.
"00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,981",1.918,"This is medication for your knee, Dad."
"00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,816",1.751,Take two tablets in the morning.
"00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,616",1.126,You've done well.
"00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,827",1.918,How did you pay back all of it?
"00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:28,455",1.001,You're amazing.
"00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,040",1.501,It's nothing.
"00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,550",4.130,"I can treat you all to beef sashimi and everything, now."
"00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:43,595",3.420,"If I make 2.8 million won now, it's all mine."
"00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,681",2.002,"I reduced the amount of money I spend,"
"00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,391",1.627,so I don't really spend much.
"00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,477",2.419,I can eat whatever I want
"00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,937",1.376,and still have some money left.
"00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:55,357",2.586,I never realized 2.8 million won was so much.
"00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,359",1.919,Just like eating an almond
"00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,070",2.085,after being on a strict diet
"00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,739",2.586,"and thinking, ""Wow, an almond could taste this good?"""
"00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,866",2.043,Is it something like that?
"00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:09,079",3.337,"Seriously, I was worried she might divorce my dad."
"00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:12,708",2.920,"So, I just sucked it up and paid it all back."
"00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,461",2.711,What would would have my stepmother thought
"00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,880",2.335,if she saw that his children had trouble with money?
"00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,174",1.710,She might regret marrying him.
"00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:26,096",3.962,She probably felt very secure that my dad owned some land.
"00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:30,726",4.129,"If my dad gets divorced, I'll have to bring him to live with us."
"00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,229",0.834,"You know,"
"00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:36,648",1.334,when my mom passed away
"00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,652",2.961,"and I was having all three meals with just my dad,"
"00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,280",2.544,I kept worrying that we might grow old together like this
"00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:44,990",1.627,if I don't do anything.
"00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:46,658",1.084,It was depressing.
"00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,497",3.795,"So I thought, ""I need to get it together and help my dad remarry."""
"00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,792",2.669,"As soon as someone set him up with a woman,"
"00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,628",1.752,I got him an exfoliation treatment
"00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,254",1.543,and a facelift.
"00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:04,051",4.296,I just can't believe Mr. Yeom even went to the dermatology clinic with you.
"00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:04,968",0.834,Right.
"00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,970",1.918,He had to if he didn't want to live with me forever.
"00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,725",3.504,And why would I ruin his marriage that we put so much effort into?
"00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:16,188",3.921,"So, I just had to suck it up and put my all into paying it back."
"00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:21,151",2.878,"Saving money may be hard, but spending it was so easy."
"00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,903",1.669,The money I saved over ten years…
"00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:26,823",3.837,That's why you don't save any. Just spend it all.
"00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,243",2.002,I really thought I hit the jackpot.
"00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:35,248",3.795,"I was going to sell sweet potato ovens to over 2,000 convenience stores."
"00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,334",2.002,"And looking at the warehouse full of ovens,"
"00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:43,548",5.505,I thought I had finally made a breakthrough in life.
"00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:48,345",3.170,But to have given all of that up…
"00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:52,516",0.834,I'm amazing.
"00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,477",1.793,I gave up selling them to stores
"00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,479",1.919,and only sold 300 of them that winter.
"00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:00,857",2.669,The other 1700 are still sitting in the warehouse.
"00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,651",1.710,The story keeps changing.
"00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,486",1.251,You said you failed
"00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:07,030",2.461,since you couldn't go to the machine testing.
"00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,782",1.668,I could but I didn't.
"00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:11,034",2.169,They were all loaded in a truck.
"00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:15,163",4.045,And the test was just a formality. They were the number one bid.
"00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:19,251",4.004,Then why didn't you go? It was all yours for the taking.
"00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,463",0.917,What?

"00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:48,760",4.838,all three of them would have to be in prison for three years.
"00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:51,471",1.126,I wouldn't go.

"00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:17,288",1.877,"He thinks, ""Shouldn't we stay with him?"""

"00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,298",3.128,and the man who was arrested is sentenced to death.
"00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,802",2.920,And the one who changed his mind testifies on his friend's behalf
"00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:32,387",1.502,and becomes imprisoned.
