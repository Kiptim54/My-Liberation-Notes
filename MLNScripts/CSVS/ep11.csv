"00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:19,730",1.376,-Thank you. -Take care.

"00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,479",2.752,but it's my first time meeting someone who drives one.
"00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:03,107",1.835,-I'm honored. -It's nothing.
"00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,902",2.712,-May I shake your hand? -Right.
"00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:07,653",1.668,I'm his friend.
"00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,989",2.252,Right…
"00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:14,702",4.213,It would be hard to park this kind of big car in an apartment complex.
"00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,162",1.377,"You don't live in one, right?"
"00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:17,872",0.918,No…
"00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:21,292",3.337,I knew it. You can't own this kind of car if you live in an apartment.
"00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,669",1.751,You've succeeded at such a young age.
"00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:29,300",4.004,"Well, it's not my car. It's my sister's boyfriend's."
"00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,552",1.293,I see.
"00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,264",2.252,"Still, it's really cool, you know?"
"00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:37,767",2.419,-It's amazing. -How much does one of these cost?

"00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,312",1.877,-But the price wouldn't matter… -All right.
"00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,605",1.210,…to people who choose to drive them.
"00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,984",4.296,You're right. Those who can afford this car wouldn't think about the price.
"00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,487",2.419,-Mom says to come home already. -It must be expensive.
"00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:52,323",2.252,-When could we ever buy this kind of car? -I know.
"00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,492",2.086,-I hope you have a good day. -Yes.
"00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,577",2.002,"-Anyway, this car's amazing. -Thank you."
"00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,536",0.875,All right.

"00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,210",1.001,"All right, well."
"00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:05,836",1.042,-Of course. -All right.
"00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,890",2.085,Did somebody visit? What's that car?
"00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,945",3.337,It's my friend's. I'm keeping it for him for a while.
"00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,950",3.087,"That friend of yours must not be Chang-hee, then."
"00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:38,869",1.501,It looks very expensive.
"00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,873",2.794,Of course. That car costs hundreds of millions of won.
"00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:47,044",3.462,That friend had to go abroad…
"00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,966",3.379,He left it here since he had to go abroad for a while. Yes.
"00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,265",2.419,"Hey, Chang-hee. What time are you leaving tomorrow?"
"00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,313",1.293,What time?
"00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,275",2.378,Why do you ask? That's so random.
"00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,485",1.334,"You'll drive the car, no?"
"00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,238",2.669,Are you just going to leave it there until he comes back?
"00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,781",1.459,So what time?
"00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:19,327",2.753,Why would I give you a ride and ruin my day from the morning?
"00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,917",3.837,Don't drive someone else's car.
"00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,775",2.294,What did Mr. Gu use to do?
"00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,027",1.085,I don't know.
"00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,739",3.045,But I feel like I have to keep it that way.
"00:03:56,822 --> 00:04:00,242",3.420,I have a feeling that he'll disappear with the car as soon as I ask

"00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:06,499",3.295,You can't buy this kind of car just because you have money.

"00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:13,005",3.003,is working under your father?
"00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:14,924",1.168,At a sink factory?
"00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:18,594",2.586,That's why I'm saying we should keep it from my dad.
"00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,389",2.044,He's working so hard teaching Gu.
"00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,973",1.501,"If he finds out he owns this car,"
"00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,768",1.710,he'll lose his motivation.
"00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:28,396",1.919,Yes. I understand.
"00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,403",3.796,"Mi-jeong's really struck gold, hasn't she?"
"00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:42,952",1.168,Don't feel small.
"00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,954",1.335,You're all right.
"00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,813",2.669,"So, what time are you leaving tomorrow?"
"00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,982",1.418,Don't even dream of it.
"00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,317",2.252,But it's her boyfriend's car. Why can't she?
"00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:16,986",1.085,I'm not riding it.
"00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,155",0.960,Why not?
"00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:21,907",1.209,There'll be traffic.
"00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,870",2.545,We need to leave at 6:30 to avoid rush hour.
"00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:27,413",1.460,Can you leave by that time?
"00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,291",1.585,I can just sleep in the car.
"00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,436",1.168,Are you nervous?
"00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,069",2.544,"Have some guts, okay?"
"00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,530",2.377,Everything good in this world could be yours.
"00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:04,366",2.752,Why can't you believe that?
"00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,079",4.629,The best man and all the money in the world could be yours.
"00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,122",0.959,Shut up.
"00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,297",1.668,Lend me some money next time.
"00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,721",3.837,"Actually, why would I borrow it? Just give it to me."
"00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,272",1.251,How fast can it go?
"00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,066",1.210,Shall I step on it?
"00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,902",2.252,"-Shall we take the highway, sir? -Hey."
"00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,321",1.919,Why would you do that in a car like this?
"00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:45,491",3.087,"You should go slow as if to tell everyone,"

"00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,133",1.960,I feel like this is too good for me.
"00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,594",1.835,I don't feel like I belong here.
"00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,722",2.377,This is way out of my league.
"00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,850",1.584,I can't even show off in it.
"00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:13,310",0.917,I feel the same.
"00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:17,064",3.670,I feel weirdly embarrassed when I get in and out of this car.
"00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,276",2.586,Maybe I'm worried other people will realize it's not mine.
"00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,902",1.543,Let's get used to it.

"00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:58,188",3.211,Maybe I should ask when you got them.

"00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,296",1.543,just looking at them?
"00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,048",0.835,It's suffocating.

"00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:25,858",1.501,You're wearing comfortable shoes.
"00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,320",2.252,I have my walking club today.

"00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,246",1.335,I'm going to make one.

"00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,049",1.710,Why not a marathon club?
"00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,804",2.127,I heard vigorous sports are not allowed
"00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,389",1.502,since you could get injured.
"00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,640",1.168,Really?
"00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,315",1.876,What do you do in the Liberation Club?

"00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,924",1.543,He never finishes them.
"00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:39,217",1.210,He just eats half
"00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,720",2.919,and leaves them for other customers to buy and file complaints.

"00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:30,059",1.751,Open the door. I know you're in there.
"00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:40,028",3.879,I wonder if her mother knows what a nasty bitch her daughter is.
"00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:44,157",4.046,A bitch who'd just date anyone and mooch off them.
"00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,660",2.669,Does she know what kind of money that was to me?
"00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:51,414",3.670,Maybe I should take a crap right here to teach her a lesson.
"00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:53,625",1.502,I mean--
"00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,169",1.335,-You… -Take a crap. Go on.
"00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:59,214",2.962,I'll release the CCTV footage and embarrass you.

"00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,467",1.418,Why you…
"00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,553",3.003,Get her! Someone get her!
"00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:09,807",4.170,That bitch! Somebody grab her!
"00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,518",2.627,"My God. Hey, stop!"
"00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,315",2.044,Just wait until I get my hands on her!
"00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,276",1.710,"Hey, come back here!"
"00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,862",1.335,That nasty…
"00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,451",1.501,Why do you want to get a table?
"00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,662",2.128,Let's just dance to a couple songs and leave.
"00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:33,331",2.586,It's on me! So don't worry and let's go.
"00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,792",1.085,Get out already.
"00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,751",0.876,Hey…
"00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,215",2.211,"Welcome, sir! You can exit the car."
"00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,174",0.876,Yes.
"00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,646",2.544,"Excuse me, sir! I need the key."
"00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,001",1.669,I don't like it here.
"00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,086",1.210,What about there?
"00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,381",2.544,-That's a bit… -Why? How much is it?
"00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,889",2.335,Just call a driver! I'll pay for it!
"00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,058",2.085,There's no way I'll let anyone else drive it.
"00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:37,770",2.794,"Hey, give a driver a chance to drive a car like that."
"00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:40,982",1.085,We'll have this one.
"00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:41,899",0.834,Of course.
"00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,076",5.046,Don't worry. I'll even pay for all the tips before we leave!
"00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,165",1.544,Are you going to die tomorrow?
"00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,059",1.460,"Today,"
"00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,062",2.211,I watched CCTV footage until my eyes popped out.
"00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:22,190",3.045,"to catch someone who had been secretly eating a 1,000-won chocolate."
"00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:25,151",2.377,And now I drove a 500 million-won car to come here
"00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,320",2.086,"to drink a 700,000-won bottle of alcohol."
"00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,155",1.752,What do you think of that?
"00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:32,825",3.587,Do you think I should hand him over to the police?
"00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,170",2.628,You really aren't listening to me today.
"00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,760",1.794,I'm only telling you.
"00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:54,263",2.877,Don't tell anyone. I don't want to get murdered.
"00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,272",1.334,This is my account balance.
"00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:08,486",2.377,My account balance!
"00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:13,825",2.878,It's nine digits. That means a hundred million won!
"00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,374",2.086,Where did you get this money?
"00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:24,502",3.045,"Today, you're a guy who drives a 500 million-won car."
"00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,671",2.086,I'm a woman who has 500 million won in her account.
"00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,588",0.834,Just enjoy.
"00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,568",0.918,Drink up!
"00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,222",1.042,Listen carefully.
"00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,559",3.253,"If I die, I've been murdered."
"00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,980",4.338,"No matter how much it looks like a suicide, that won't be the case."
"00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,900",2.837,I will never commit suicide.
"00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,569",1.585,"If I die,"
"00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,614",2.419,I've been murdered because of the 500 million won.
"00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,933",1.544,All that expensive alcohol…
"00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,810",1.794,"Who are you, Jeong A-reum?"
"00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,978",2.085,"Saying ""This is expensive"" all the time."
"00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:09,065",3.003,So what? Do I have to like everything if they're expensive?
"00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,528",2.753,You know I don't like loud places.
"00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,781",2.086,Have you ever seen me go to a club?
"00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,331",1.251,"Just go to sleep, asshole."
"00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,292",1.793,"Hyehwa and then Sanpo, please."
"00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,100",3.421,SANPO SINKS CLOSETS
"00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,033",0.876,What are you doing?
"00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:39,692",1.001,Nothing.
"00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:03,842",1.335,"ADD COLOR, ADD SHADOW, UNDERLINE"
"00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,510",1.585,"ADD COLOR, MAKE IT BIGGER, SHADOW"
"00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,056",2.586,"Mi-jeong, are you really going to change it like this?"
"00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,353",2.669,I have to if he tells me to. What choice do I have?
"00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,565",3.129,What you did is a hundred times better than what he told you to do.
"00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:21,818",3.170,Everything he does is just cheap and showy.
"00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:23,987",2.086,That's just the kind of man he is.
"00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:28,366",3.629,But your work has an elegance to it.
"00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:32,370",3.921,Your designs always make me stop and look at them.
"00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:35,165",2.712,That's why I always get jealous when I look at your work.
"00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,209",1.626,Are you really going to edit it?
"00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,717",3.587,I want to bring this to the branding department as it is.
"00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,596",3.796,I want them to know how that man is ruining all this work.
"00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,391",1.585,Are you worshiping me?
"00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:01,357",2.836,Ms. Yeom and I will go to Gwangju next week
"00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,235",2.794,and take care of the researcher training.
"00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,949",2.794,"All right, that's all for today. Good work."
"00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,159",1.126,Thank you.
"00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:13,578",2.336,Good work.
"00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,622",1.961,Why don't we have lunch together?
"00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:16,706",1.001,What do you want?
"00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:20,001",2.252,How about dry bulgogi? It's been a while.
"00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,419",1.335,Sounds great.
"00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:23,546",2.044,Don't we have to queue at that place?
"00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:26,507",1.751,Please spare me.
"00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,801",2.210,I can't stand in line right now. I'm too tired.
"00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,637",1.752,You seemed okay for a while.
"00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,388",1.668,This comes and goes in cycles.
"00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:34,724",2.252,"Three days of the week are so tiring,"
"00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,809",2.002,"the other three are just barely manageable,"
"00:32:36,893 --> 00:32:39,562",2.669,and I don't even know how the last day goes.
"00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:44,234",4.588,"When I'm tired, just looking at people queueing makes me angry."
"00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:45,652",1.335,It just pisses me off.
"00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:49,280",3.044,That's why I can't take buses.
"00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:52,325",2.961,The queues for the buses going to Gyeonggi-do are so long
"00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:55,620",3.212,that they look like really long strings of beads.
"00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:59,374",3.671,Just looking at it drives my blood pressure up.
"00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,584",1.543,There are just too many people.
"00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:04,462",2.794,So it takes forever for my turn to come.
"00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,547",2.002,I can't get anything when I want them.
"00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:10,009",3.378,"I have to wait for everything. For food, to get back home, and even men."
"00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,223",2.503,"It seems you're just angry, not tired."
"00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,478",2.711,What is it? What made you so angry?
"00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:26,776",2.419,I think I have an inkling.
"00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:35,660",4.963,He promised to treat me twice but hasn't texted me even once.
"00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:37,787",1.251,So there is someone.
"00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,625",2.627,I'm sure he knows I'm looking at my phone all day.
"00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,085",0.834,Does he?
"00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,629",1.293,How could he not?
"00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:49,215",2.502,When I'm emitting this huge energy into the universe?
"00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,092",1.793,How could it not reach him?
"00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:54,429",2.753,"I mean, it's already been three days since he promised."
"00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,432",2.920,But he hasn't called or texted me.
"00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,312",1.168,I'm sorry.
"00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:05,315",2.420,Gosh. He must be psychic.
"00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:13,823",1.001,He messaged her.
"00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:17,410",0.876,Today?
"00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:19,996",1.543,Today is too sudden.
"00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:23,082",2.586,Put it off for a few days. He's had you waiting this long.
"00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,628",4.045,Contacting a woman and asking to meet on the same day isn't polite.
"00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,047",1.335,Play hard to get.
"00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,970",2.544,It's not interesting if you say yes at once.
"00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,348",2.294,A guy gets anxious the most
"00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:41,142",2.711,when a girl plays hard to get.
"00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,894",1.669,That's when guys go crazy.
"00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,813",2.836,Just relax and put it off. It'll be fine.
"00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:51,778",3.754,"Let's make him anxious, Ms. Yeom."
"00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,863",2.002,Try making a man wait for once.
"00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:56,074",2.128,Why do you always have to be the one who waits?
"00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,634",1.335,So when is it going to be?
"00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:16,969",0.834,Tomorrow.
"00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:20,223",1.919,Some delay that is.
"00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:24,143",3.837,Yes. That's the charm of Ms. Yeom.
"00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:30,024",2.961,But is it a good thing
"00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,068",1.168,to make him anxious?
"00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,907",2.377,Why is it a good thing? He's anxious.
"00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:44,122",3.087,"You get anxious, and it drives you crazy."
"00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,375",2.586,"Isn't that a bad thing? It's uncomfortable, isn't it?"
"00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:52,630",5.172,"When a man and a woman like each other, shouldn't you give each other the fullest?"
"00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:55,258",2.545,Why would you string it out in small portions?
"00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:56,217",0.876,What is that?
"00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,678",2.378,You'll be murdered if you feed someone like that.
"00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:01,305",2.544,So why do I have to give out my affection like that?
"00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:05,268",3.879,What's good about not getting enough? Shouldn't you give as much as you can?
"00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:07,854",2.503,Getting anxious and playing hard-to-get…
"00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:12,275",4.338,Aren't they all bad things? Rather than good?
"00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:15,361",0.876,"I mean,"
"00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:18,906",2.794,"it may not be good,"
"00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,033",2.043,but that doesn't mean it's bad.
"00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:23,494",2.377,It doesn't necessarily mean
"00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:24,871",1.293,it's bad.
"00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:26,581",1.627,It's just dissatisfying.
"00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:31,711",4.004,"Or insufficient, you could say."
"00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,515",1.626,"She's meeting him today, isn't she?"
"00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,934",1.751,Why had I always believed
"00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,395",1.585,that this was a good thing?
"00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,073",1.293,"-Excuse me. -Yes, sir."
"00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:03,910",2.753,"-Can I park my car there? -Yes, just leave your number there."
"00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,036",1.043,-My number? -Yes.
"00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:37,777",1.001,Hi.
"00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,028",1.168,Hi.
"00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:41,656",1.252,Is it here?
"00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,032",1.293,No.
"00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:45,910",1.085,It's that one.
"00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:56,045",4.213,"This place is very popular with drinkers for its food,"
"00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,130",2.002,"so you usually have to wait for two months,"
"00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,425",2.711,"but someone canceled their reservation today, so…"
"00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,135",1.626,I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.
"00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,512",1.293,It's okay.
"00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,847",2.252,I'm glad we didn't have to wait.
"00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:15,314",4.379,I didn't even ask what you like and just chose this place on my own.
"00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:17,942",1.877,I'm not picky at all.
"00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,072",3.754,"Sometimes I want to be picky, but I can't. Even intestines and chicken gizzards."
"00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:25,408",1.335,What am I saying?
"00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,077",1.960,-What's with me? -May I take your order?
"00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,079",1.919,We'll take Course A.
"00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:31,539",1.377,-Course A it is. -Yes.
"00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:32,665",1.043,For drinks…
"00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,543",2.169,I'll take <i>so-maek</i>.
"00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:37,295",1.669,"Then, one soju and one beer, please."
"00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:39,589",2.211,"One soju, one beer. Coming right up."
"00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:44,176",1.418,It sounds like English.
"00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:46,387",0.959,"""<i>So-maek.</i>"""
"00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,061",2.752,"You know how we emphasize the ""s"" in ""soju""?"
"00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:56,063",1.918,"So it sounds more like English. ""<i>So-maek.</i>"""
"00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:57,565",0.876,Right.
"00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,407",1.168,Hello?
"00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:12,288",2.086,We need to park here.
"00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:14,123",1.752,Right. I'll move right away.
"00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,082",0.876,"-Yes, thanks. -Sure."
"00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:22,256",2.294,-I need to go move my car. -All right.
"00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,091",1.751,-Okay. -Take your time.
"00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,270",1.585,"This street's one-way, too."
"00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:44,362",2.670,I've come too far.
"00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:56,582",1.627,PAID PARKING LOT
"00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,875",1.209,How long will you stay?
"00:39:58,668 --> 00:39:59,919",1.251,I'm not sure.
"00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,462",1.460,We close at 10 p.m.
"00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:05,508",2.586,"-Well, I'll come back before that. -Payment?"
"00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,926",1.335,I'll pay now.
"00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:08,594",0.959,Until ten.
"00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:16,560",0.959,"Hi, where are you?"
"00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:17,687",1.043,I'm at home.
"00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,897",1.209,"Right, did you drink?"
"00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,316",2.336,"No, but I'm going to right now."
"00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,694",1.168,Don't!
"00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,781",2.669,Come get my car. I'll send you the address. It's not far.
"00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:54,598",1.334,I'm sorry.
"00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,143",1.377,It's okay.
"00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:59,311",2.085,I shouldn't have brought my car.
"00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:01,147",1.752,The restaurant called out of the blue.
"00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:07,236",2.544,The beer's warm now. Shall I ask for a fresh bottle?
"00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,195",0.876,Excuse me.
"00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:09,238",0.959,No.
"00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,824",2.503,It's okay. Just catch your breath.
"00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,202",0.834,What?
"00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,956",2.252,"Catch your breath, just for a minute."
"00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:52,615",1.168,You didn't have to run.
"00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:58,704",1.960,I parked too far away.
"00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:13,093",2.585,Now I can finally drink comfortably.
"00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,141",1.626,POWER OFF
"00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,069",1.710,What do you want for dinner?
"00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:31,904",1.752,"It's too late to eat, isn't it?"
"00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:34,448",1.877,"Then, what?"
"00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,409",1.668,I'm tired. I want to go home.
"00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:39,453",0.959,Is that so?
"00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,164",1.626,"Why did I wait for you, then?"
"00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,629",2.836,Shall we go to Paju this weekend? To see the suspension bridge.
"00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:49,964",1.252,I have a study group.
"00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,465",0.834,All weekend?
"00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,510",2.461,I need to rest for a day.
"00:42:58,305 --> 00:42:59,139",0.834,All right.
"00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,225",0.959,"That's it, then."
"00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,519",2.211,We're over as of today. Goodbye.
"00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:11,026",3.211,You study or meet your friends
"00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:13,362",1.668,four or five days a week.
"00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,783",3.253,But you ask me about who I meet every time I meet someone. What is this?
"00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,661",2.377,We agreed to date yet have rarely gone out on one.
"00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,582",1.919,We see each other every day at work.
"00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,334",2.043,Do we have to meet up outside too?
"00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,212",1.835,Is seeing each other enough?
"00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:32,715",1.919,I see everyone at work every day.
"00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:34,884",2.086,"If I've seen someone at work for ten years,"
"00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,844",1.877,have I gone out with them for ten years?
"00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:39,013",0.835,It's over.
"00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:44,643",2.627,People say you're a player.
"00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:51,317",2.169,So I was just keeping an eye on you for a while.
"00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,027",1.001,To see if it's true.
"00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,157",1.877,I've never taken a break from dating.
"00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:00,367",1.459,But I've never two-timed anyone.
"00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:02,953",1.835,Or jumped from one girl to another.
"00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,080",1.543,I told you that a few times.
"00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,960",2.085,"Well, you can keep keeping an eye on me."
"00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:11,670",0.959,But I'm done.
"00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,094",1.334,This is what always happens.
"00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,223",2.752,"""Do I owe her something?"""
"00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:27,686",2.919,"""Why does it feel like I owe her something?"""
"00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:32,900",1.585,I feel frustrated somehow.
"00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:33,859",0.876,Yes.
"00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:37,363",2.628,"So I end up saying, ""Let's break up."""
"00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:40,949",1.292,And that's how it ends.
"00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:46,580",2.127,It really is over now.
"00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,927",1.543,-Thank you. -Thank you.
"00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,762",1.752,-Have a good night. -Thank you.
"00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:06,266",2.502,"Hui-seon, I'll go pick up the car."
"00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,353",3.003,Hurry back. We need to go get an electric toothbrush for Yu-Rim.
"00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:11,980",2.544,"Let's go together now, then. There are no customers, anyway."
"00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:13,232",1.168,-Shall we? -Yes.
"00:45:13,941 --> 00:45:15,192",1.251,Thank you.
"00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:17,403",0.835,Let's go.
"00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:20,197",2.711,"If it was around here, he should've come to our place."
"00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,157",1.877,Why is he paying for drinks elsewhere?
"00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,285",2.168,<i>The phone you called is turned off.</i>
"00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,789",3.420,<i>You'll be directed to voicemail after the beep.</i>
"00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:34,420",1.001,I…
"00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,508",2.461,I think I would be liberated if I shaved my head.
"00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:47,266",4.088,"To me, shaving my head means that I become a mere animal."
"00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:48,809",1.460,A nameless animal.
"00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,729",2.336,I feel like it would be all right to live like that.
"00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:56,400",4.004,It's not like I've achieved anything by trying so hard.
"00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:59,445",2.044,I wish I hadn't been living like that.
"00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:04,742",3.671,"It just feels like, if I shave my head, my desire to look nice"
"00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,243",1.418,and my desire for a man
"00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,537",1.793,would all go away.
"00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:11,623",1.376,So I've decided.

"00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:10,648",2.920,You snuck into the hospital every night and coaxed a sick kid

"00:56:54,919 --> 00:56:57,338",2.419,Even a single point is too much for you!
