"00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,869",1.901,You should've parked in the shade.
"00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,310",1.861,It was in the shade earlier.
"00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,535",3.143,You should've parked so it would be in the shade when you came out.
"00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,900",1.282,How am I supposed to know that?
"00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,547",2.027,You don't even know which way the sun sets?
"00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,490",1.861,Where will this shade move to later?
"00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,682",2.108,I'm sure it'll go wherever it wants to go.

"00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:35,732",4.715,it's amazing to have a barbecue here.

"00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,966",1.242,"but cozy, you know?"
"00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,330",0.869,Yes.
"00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,397",1.364,Sounds really nice.
"00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,996",1.862,You should invite us some time.
"00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,966",1.861,"Yes. Of course, yes."
"00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,248",1.200,You promise?

"00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,466",1.117,Bye.
"00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,037",1.488,We'll be off then. Goodbye.
"00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,188",2.067,See you at school after the break.
"00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,000",2.109,Sure. Take care.
"00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,459",2.894,Why won't you accept payment for the farm work?
"00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,704",2.606,It's because I like doing it.
"00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,426",3.143,"Still, I feel bad making you work for free."
"00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,419",0.911,Let me pay you.
"00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,479",1.820,It's really fine. I enjoy it.
"00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:46,077",3.515,"But still, it doesn't sit right with us."
"00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,979",1.820,We should pay you for--

"00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,893",2.937,"He enjoys it, so take a hint and stop insisting."
"00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,537",1.034,What?
"00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:26,853",1.075,Keep at it.
"00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:31,650",3.143,I have you at my mercy. How dare you glare at me like that?
"00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,854",2.854,What does it feel like to date someone who lives in the area?
"00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,700",3.143,"You're just like the people in Seoul, dating within the neighborhood."
"00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:47,076",2.771,"All this time, I thought you had to take the bus and the train"
"00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,846",2.688,to go all the way to Seoul to meet someone.
"00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:54,603",4.674,I never even imagined you would be able to find someone in this countryside.
"00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,539",2.854,It's so nice and economical. You can even eat together at home.

"00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,687",2.440,I can see you too. Since you're fat.
"00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,902",2.027,I'm dying of hunger.
"00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:50,845",1.158,Are you that hungry?
"00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,417",1.489,I feel like I'm going to die.
"00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,518",2.068,Right. Go have dinner if you're hungry.
"00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,785",1.943,Come with me. Let's eat together.
"00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,308",1.448,"No, I'm not hungry."
"00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,169",0.951,What's wrong?
"00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,676",1.198,What happened?
"00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,433",1.282,"Apparently, Ms. Kwak"
"00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,872",1.612,broke up with her boyfriend.
"00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,952",0.952,All right.
"00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,708",1.654,Don't you have any coffee beans?
"00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,858",1.447,They're in the freezer.
"00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,622",1.324,I'll have an iced americano.
"00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,441",0.910,Me too.
"00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,040",1.655,You said you weren't hungry.
"00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100",1.200,I was just pretending.
"00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,506",0.911,To look sentimental.
"00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,848",2.771,You're lucky I forced you to eat with me.
"00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,799",0.868,"You know, right?"
"00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:00,322",2.440,How much I hate being messed with when I'm hungry.
"00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,491",1.944,When is Ms. Kwak going to get married?
"00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,849",1.283,She should already.
"00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,371",2.440,"You always get hopeful when she breaks up with someone,"
"00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,480",2.027,and become hopeless once she starts dating someone new.
"00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,450",3.349,"At this rate, if she does get married, you'll wait for her to get divorced."
"00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,214",2.730,I never waited for her. Ever.
"00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:26,169",1.117,"You know already, right?"
"00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,692",1.159,It's not going to work.
"00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,132",0.993,I know.
"00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,895",1.035,But…
"00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,830",2.315,"when I heard that she broke up with her boyfriend,"
"00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,553",2.275,my heart started beating fast again.
"00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:51,644",4.053,I don't get how you can like someone so much that your heart pounds.
"00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:57,970",2.977,It's not that I've never liked anyone that much.
"00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,742",1.861,I've never really liked anyone that much.
"00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:05,952",3.598,"Anyway, my heart only pounds when something bad is happening."
"00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,806",1.406,"When I'm embarrassed,"
"00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:10,873",1.158,"when I'm angry,"
"00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,521",1.696,before a 100-meter sprint…
"00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,457",1.614,It was always for bad things.
"00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,352",2.316,My heart never beat fast because I liked someone.
"00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,818",2.233,"When I really like someone,"
"00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,367",2.647,I think the opposite happens. My heart beats even slower.
"00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,683",1.655,Like I've been freed from something.
"00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:36,349",4.054,Like I feel peace in my heart for the first time.
"00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:42,841",1.323,I guess I'm just weird.
"00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,292",2.150,Mi-Jeong just gave the perfect answer.
"00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,635",1.448,"When you're happy, you just are."
"00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,083",1.366,But your heart pounds
"00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,687",2.522,when you think you have a chance at something.
"00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,301",1.530,Like some kind of expectation.
"00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,534",2.151,"When something's yours, you just know."
"00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:04,759",3.143,"Does your heart pound when you get paid? No, because it's yours."
"00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,192",2.812,"But when it's not yours and you know it's not,"
"00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,714",2.440,but you think you might get it if things work out…
"00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,575",1.778,That's when your heart starts pounding.
"00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,057",1.655,Relationships are the same.
"00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,835",1.696,"Some married couples say,"
"00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,986",2.068,"""I just knew they were the one at first sight."""
"00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,342",2.274,"If you ask them, they say when they met,"
"00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,948",2.522,"it was like, ""You're the one."""
"00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,726",1.696,"Their hearts didn't beat like crazy,"
"00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,001",2.192,"but they were just like, ""You're the one."""
"00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,151",1.364,You just know that it's yours.
"00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:34,948",3.721,Relationships are like that. There's nothing to long for. It's yours.
"00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,133",3.102,Rich people don't yearn for designer clothes. They just buy them.
"00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:43,964",5.128,"When you desperately long for something, your soul already knows deep down"
"00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,412",1.366,that it's not yours.
"00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:49,754",3.722,"You want it, but you know it's not yours. That's what drives you crazy."
"00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,682",0.868,Damn it!
"00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,088",0.868,"Oh, my God!"
"00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,149",1.944,So that's why I can't have a car.
"00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,145",3.018,"Well, tell your soul that you can have it."
"00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,461",2.233,You try. You try telling your soul.
"00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:10,389",3.845,That things might work out with her. You try making your soul admit that.
"00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,270",0.910,Damn it.

"00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,877",1.489,Just tell them you're sorry
"00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,565",2.067,and come with us to do our nails. All right?

"00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,463",1.738,You know how far I live.
"00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:03,970",3.888,"When I carry something heavy on my way home, I just want to throw it away."
"00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,161",2.109,I even want to toss out my own body somewhere.
"00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,857",1.033,Throw out.
"00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,098",1.158,Throw out.
"00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,737",3.556,"Hey, can you come over to my office? I have too much to carry by myself."
"00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,922",1.737,What club?
"00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,741",1.737,When will you be done?
"00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,892",1.365,Damn it!
"00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,125",1.076,Then what do I do?
"00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:27,253",2.977,"After breathing, what I do the most"
"00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,561",2.109,is look at this watch.

"00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:46,565",3.887,"I go to work, finish work, eat, and sleep. Every day is the same."
"00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,701",2.151,So why do I keep looking at my watch?
"00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:58,435",4.633,"I think I feel a compulsion to live a productive day,"
"00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,247",2.192,but there's not much to show for it.
"00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,762",3.433,I'm just constantly looking at my watch and being chased by time.
"00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,883",3.309,"As soon as I realized I've lived that way my whole life,"
"00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,439",2.440,"weirdly, my heart suddenly started"
"00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:22,007",6.286,"to pound like thump, thump, thump."
"00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,763",3.639,"Before, it was like bam-bam-bam-bam."
"00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,827",4.260,I can't believe it took me about 50 years to realize this.
"00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,933",2.523,I'm kind of like that too.
"00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,861",2.646,Doesn't everyone experience something like that?
"00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:52,403",4.549,"And since you spent all your time wisely like that,"
"00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,057",1.571,"not wasting a single second,"
"00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,159",3.019,you were able to become an important member within the company.

"00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:15,314",2.026,and waking up when I've slept enough…
"00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,126",2.109,Finding my own rhythm like that
"00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:21,683",2.648,might be the liberation I need the most.

"00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,395",1.654,Why is this…
"00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,448",2.564,I was worried someone would see.
"00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,505",2.606,Someone's been calling you. Should we take a break?
"00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,579",0.992,Shall we?
"00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,109",1.446,It's fine. We don't have to.
"00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,178",1.985,Let's take a ten-minute break.

"00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:35,873",0.868,I like it.
"00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,810",1.447,"Now that I've participated,"
"00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,077",2.647,I can see exactly what kind of club this is.

"00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,405",1.571,I'm so exhausted.
"00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:13,879",3.391,Just tell them you live far away. I'm sure they'll let you go.

"00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,365",1.614,I have a lot of stuff with me.
"00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,342",2.895,So what do I do? Do you want me to sleep on the street tonight?

"00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,392",0.951,Well…

"00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,028",0.992,Shall I?
"00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,634",1.324,Carry that for me.

"00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,810",2.274,Why don't I do it?
"00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,995",2.647,-Why don't you give it to me? -No. I can do it.
"00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,882",1.157,"I mean,"
"00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:03,017",4.052,won't it be uncomfortable if the store owner is your colleague's father?
"00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:05,126",1.198,Uncomfortable? Never.
"00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,345",3.516,I treat all of the store owners like my own mother and father.
"00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,330",0.868,Gosh.
"00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,646",1.365,My dad's hard to deal with.
"00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,541",2.233,My dad isn't a walk in the park either.
"00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:21,627",1.116,All right then.
"00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,984",1.777,Am I crazy? Why would I give it to her?
"00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,680",1.612,The daily revenue there is huge.
"00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,038",2.275,Who knows what she'll do with it?
"00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,229",2.109,She'll probably plot with her dad
"00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,917",2.605,and order tons of the new products to get a promotion.
"00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,605",2.026,She thinks she's the only smart one.
"00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:40,403",4.715,"Gosh, you've put a stop to A-reum's plan for an easy promotion."
"00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,678",2.193,Of course. That store's under my management.
"00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:46,648",2.896,"Even A-reum must be the perfect girl to some guy, right?"
"00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,550",1.820,She's good at work and makes good money.
"00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,321",2.151,That guy will never be my friend.
"00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,091",2.688,I'll hate him. I don't even have to meet him to know that.
"00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,378",2.524,Give me a list of the people who put you in that fight.
"00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,155",1.695,I can't just let it slide.
"00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,843",2.604,I spent all last night running simulations in my head.
"00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,498",1.571,I've already planned out
"00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:09,640",3.059,"all the things I'll do to them, all the curses I'll say,"
"00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,006",1.282,and with what expression.
"00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,949",1.861,Just give me the list.
"00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,059",1.820,I'm good friends with them now.
"00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,112",2.771,How? Why? For what reason?
"00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,510",1.448,It happened when we were young.
"00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,867",1.860,Being young is no excuse.
"00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,811",1.861,Just give me the list
"00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:38,383",1.489,so I can at least curse them!
"00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:47,811",1.943,You're my sister's friend. Why don't you…
"00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:58,109",2.316,I'll find out myself at all costs.
"00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,214",0.951,I've…
"00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,654",1.488,got to run now.
"00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:10,515",1.034,Have a good lunch.
"00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:37,355",3.309,I was wondering if anything else might be sent in the mail.
"00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,201",2.068,I can't let my family find out.
"00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:44,799",1.902,"Mail is sent when there's a delinquency,"
"00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:48,479",3.597,"a change in the interest rate, or if a notice needs to be given."
"00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:54,476",1.903,What about filing a lawsuit?
"00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:57,412",2.357,Your account has the transaction records.
"00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,191",1.696,You can file a lawsuit with that.
"00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:05,270",3.185,You can't keep paying it off for him forever like this.
"00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:07,007",1.655,It's not a small amount.
"00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:18,338",3.350,HANJO BANK
"00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,083",3.433,My family is about to find out that I took out a loan to lend you money.
"00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,647",2.482,We need to talk today. Call me.
"00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,237",2.026,Hey. Aren't you going home?
"00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,035",2.895,"-No, I'm going to head out later. -Why?"
"00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,226",1.116,I have plans.
"00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,625",1.820,Plans? That's rare.
"00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:47,700",0.992,See you tomorrow.
"00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,354",1.571,-See you. -Bye.
"00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:07,923",1.820,I'm not going home until you pick up.
"00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:29,345",0.993,Hello?
"00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,157",1.365,"It's me, Se-yeong."
"00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,375",1.241,Why are you picking up?
"00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,428",1.779,I have nothing to talk about with you.
"00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:43,530",1.448,Let me talk to Chan-hyeok.
"00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,285",2.978,"I'm really sorry, Mi-jeong,"
"00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,222",1.985,but Chan-hyeok really doesn't have money.
"00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,413",1.282,He honestly doesn't.
"00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,515",2.316,I had him come over because he might actually die
"00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,334",1.199,if he stayed in Korea.
"00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,049",2.315,"Soon, my cards will be frozen,"
"00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,447",1.777,and I'll become a delinquent borrower.
"00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,790",2.482,Why should I become a delinquent borrower?
"00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:14,008",1.323,"I'm really sorry,"
"00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,407",1.406,but I don't know what to do.
"00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,072",3.432,I'm also living from hand to mouth.
"00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:29,392",2.109,-Who is it? -It's nothing.
"00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:30,798",1.323,Tell me who it is.
"00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:32,949",1.572,-Give it here. -Just leave it.
"00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:34,314",1.282,"I said, give it to me!"
"00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,776",1.695,What are you two doing over there?
"00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:49,326",2.523,I guess you had the money to fly there?
"00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:52,220",1.157,I came to sell my organs.
"00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,333",1.612,I guess you haven't sold any yet?
"00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:07,976",2.853,I'll be a delinquent borrower soon. Then I'll have to quit my job.
"00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,402",2.233,"Your family has money, don't they?"
"00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,868",3.556,They can pay it off for you so why would you become a delinquent borrower?
"00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:22,121",2.813,Why should I ask my family when it's your fault?
"00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,289",3.639,"I'll pay you back. But since it's urgent, pay it first."
"00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:29,192",1.820,I'll pay you back later.
"00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:32,873",3.599,What do you expect me to do? I literally have no money right now.
"00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,042",2.357,"Whatever you do, you can make at least 1,500,000 won."
"00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:42,301",3.184,"Hey, do you think you're the only one asking me to pay them back?"
"00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:47,140",4.176,"I'm trying my best to make money, but they're chasing me and ruining everything,"
"00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:49,662",2.440,telling me to cough it up immediately.
"00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:52,474",2.728,How can I do that unless I steal it from somewhere?
"00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,701",3.143,"They blame me if I sleep, they blame me if I eat."
"00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:58,595",2.812,"Unless I starve to death, they'll never believe me."
"00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:03,144",4.052,Stop trying to say I'm not paying you back because I don't want to!
"00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:09,183",1.655,How could you do this to me?
"00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,525",1.696,How could you do this to me?
"00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,720",2.770,Don't. Stop it!
"00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,600",1.985,Stop it!
"00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,752",2.109,I don't know how it got like this.
"00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:15,682",2.524,I just decided to focus on one thing only.
"00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,501",0.992,Jung Chan-hyeok…
"00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:21,016",2.398,I won't let him die while he's by my side.
"00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,693",1.571,Drink slowly.
"00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,104",2.688,"It's me, you know. It's exactly me."
"00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,874",2.067,No one could feel weak if they were with me.
"00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:54,348",3.391,"I'm the pick-up girl, the girl who's like a Jindo dog."
"00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,442",1.902,All he has to do is be with me.
"00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,213",2.068,I want to tell him it's me so badly.
"00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:12,710",4.756,"You know, I really want to tell him to go out with me right now."
"00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:14,943",1.034,Should I just say it?
"00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,147",0.827,What?
"00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,132",1.283,Why shouldn't I?
"00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:24,703",1.034,Who said you shouldn't?
"00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:27,639",2.854,"Hey, I'm turning 40 soon."
"00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,666",1.944,I decided to love anyone this winter.
"00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:32,478",2.730,"But he isn't just anyone, not by a long shot."
"00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,925",1.365,He's a genuinely decent guy.
"00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:36,034",1.530,Tell him if you want to.
"00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,749",2.316,How can someone change so much in just one month?
"00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,313",2.482,Remember what you said here a month ago?
"00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,952",1.737,"Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?"
"00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,689",1.655,A slap in his face won't cut it.
"00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,550",1.778,I should just put three bullets in him.
"00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:58,779",4.094,"Time's a fickle friend, right?"
"00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:50,102",2.524,Why is it so difficult to tell someone you like them?
"00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,493",2.192,It's not like you're telling them you hate them.
"00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:58,786",3.805,Because your soul knows you're going to get rejected for sure.
"00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:04,079",2.812,"If you hesitate to say something but then actually say it,"
"00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:06,106",1.944,you're guaranteed to regret it.
"00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:09,208",3.020,You hesitate because you know you shouldn't say it.
"00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:13,922",3.970,But you still end up saying it and making yourself miserable.
"00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,264",3.639,"Humans are really nonsensical animals, you know?"
"00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:24,591",0.827,Du-hwan.
"00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:29,306",3.185,"Stray puppy, egg white, one-won coin."
"00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,986",3.598,"What's wrong with you, you unbearably old-fashioned egg white?"
"00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,667",1.034,Don't do it.
"00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:40,885",1.778,Just don't.
"00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,615",1.282,You know what Gi-Jeong said?
"00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,288",4.012,She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone because they told her they liked her.
"00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:54,119",4.466,She wanted to shoot anyone who smiled or winked at her.
"00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,732",1.531,She was always looking for a gun.
"00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:57,717",1.902,"If someone below her standards liked her,"
"00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,785",1.985,she would go off as if they had insulted her.
"00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:01,398",0.827,"Girls, you know?"
"00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,375",2.895,"If a guy they think is below them says he likes them,"
"00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,691",2.233,they get deeply insulted.
"00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,454",2.564,Every girl in the world is like that.
"00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,687",0.827,Except Hyeon-a.
"00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:16,534",2.523,"Everyone used to like her when we were in school, right?"
"00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:20,545",3.474,"Seriously, literally everyone, including some weirdos, said they liked her."
"00:41:21,538 --> 00:41:24,929",3.391,She was so kind even to them.
"00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:27,493",1.737,Even when she was rejecting them.
"00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:30,098",1.282,"When we were in college,"
"00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,199",2.564,I saw her get rejected by guys a few times.
"00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:35,763",1.240,But she didn't…
"00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,396",2.069,"She didn't even get mad, you know?"
"00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,952",2.192,She didn't even get embarrassed or anything.
"00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,640",2.605,She always used to be grateful
"00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:49,163",2.440,to the boys who liked her at school when she was young.
"00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,313",2.068,So she assumes others feel that way.
"00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:55,200",3.143,That's why Hyeon-a is the only one of us who's always dating.
"00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,764",2.480,Yeom Gi-jeong? She's going to love anyone this winter?
"00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,115",3.267,I don't think so. She can't. Nothing's happened so far.
"00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:04,175",2.978,There's no way someone decent will ask her out all of a sudden.
"00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:09,385",5.128,That means she has to ask first. Someone decent or literally anyone.
"00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,197",2.729,"But how will she, knowing what she's done in her life?"
"00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,051",2.771,Maybe the guy will end up shooting her dead.
"00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:21,130",4.094,What I'm saying is that it's her karma.
"00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:24,770",2.193,But you went out with anyone too easily.
"00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,548",1.696,Mi-rim really wasn't a good idea.
"00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,491",1.860,I had no choice. She said she liked me.
"00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,138",1.985,But still. I can't believe you dated her.
"00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,461",1.240,"Hey, that's enough."
"00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:34,282",1.200,She's someone's mom now.
"00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:35,604",1.240,I'm home.
"00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,683",1.943,-You're here. -Hey.
"00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:55,000",1.737,Who asked who out first?
"00:42:58,432 --> 00:42:59,342",0.910,"With Mr. Gu, I mean."
"00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:03,932",0.827,I did.
"00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:10,591",1.654,I didn't ask him to go out with me.
"00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,388",1.531,I told him to worship me.
"00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:17,745",0.992,What?
"00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,268",1.323,I told him to worship me.
"00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:09,439",3.102,SLIDE TO ANSWER
"00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:14,154",0.869,Yes?
"00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,552",1.199,Hello?
"00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,158",1.324,"Yes, what?"
"00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,970",2.151,"Hey, you asshole. How could you…"
"00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,594",3.805,How could you ignore a message from your brother saying he was dying?
"00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:33,135",4.962,"If I were really dying, I would've killed you before I died."
"00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,741",2.522,Where are you hiding? Are you even in Seoul?
"00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,813",3.433,Sam-sik ran into Chairman Shin at a funeral recently.
"00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,832",2.482,"Apparently, he asked if he was in contact with you."
"00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:50,174",3.267,You know he's not important enough to be able to talk to the chairman.
"00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:53,151",2.894,But it seemed the old man followed him to the restroom.
"00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:59,727",4.714,I'm hearing that Mr. Baek has fallen out of favor with the chairman.
"00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,351",4.591,"If we just step in here, it'll be over for Mr. Baek."
"00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,438",2.068,"Hey, are you listening?"
"00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,126",1.406,How's Ssaebi doing?
"00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:14,491",0.828,Ssaebi?
"00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:16,311",0.827,Yes.
"00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:19,618",2.480,How would I know? I haven't seen him in ages either.
"00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,893",1.323,Why do you ask about Ssaebi?
"00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:24,871",1.613,Did someone take your money?
"00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:27,766",1.241,How much?
"00:45:33,184 --> 00:45:36,037",2.853,NAME: YEOM MI-JEONG
"00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:46,582",3.267,Have you looked into this? You'd probably be at the top of the list.
"00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:51,131",2.729,I just want to close the account.
"00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,749",1.779,It will mature in four months.
"00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:11,644",1.572,HANJO BANK LOAN PAYMENT RECEIPT
"00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:20,038",0.909,Thank you.
"00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:24,836",1.117,Miss.
"00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,945",1.034,Cheer up.
"00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,156",1.696,DANGMI TOWN OFFICE
"00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:00,112",1.200,Did you buy something?
"00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:02,800",1.406,Why are you here at this hour?
"00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:08,259",3.681,I had something to take care of. I asked for a half-day off.
"00:47:10,823 --> 00:47:12,560",1.737,You must have finished early today.
"00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:31,170",2.069,It's not that hot today.
"00:47:31,873 --> 00:47:33,403",1.530,Seems like summer's almost over.
"00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:58,960",2.812,I've changed my address back.
"00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:02,682",1.613,What if more mail comes?
"00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:04,792",0.993,That won't happen.
"00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,190",1.200,I sorted it out.
"00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:10,540",1.324,Did you pay it off for him?
"00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,178",1.612,He says he'll pay me back later.
"00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:18,811",1.200,I'm sure he will.
"00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:24,435",1.406,What's this asshole's name?
"00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:29,315",1.737,Don't worry. He says he will.
"00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,285",1.944,I just need his name and phone number.
"00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:36,097",2.026,I won't do it myself. Someone else will do it.
"00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,154",1.324,Are you still not over him?
"00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:29,797",0.992,You're scaring me.
"00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:32,278",1.116,Why don't you sit down?
"00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,737",2.192,How far do you want me to go?
"00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,327",3.308,You could've just told me that I dealt with it well without making a mess.
"00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:45,718",1.860,Why do you keep bringing me down?
"00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:50,599",1.654,"I'm the kind of idiot,"
"00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:54,238",2.729,you only see on the internet that gives money away to guys.
"00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,663",3.350,Do you want my parents and everyone in the world to know that?
"00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,742",1.530,"You're scared of that, aren't you?"
"00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,077",2.977,That bastard knows you are. That's why he's doing this to you.
"00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,622",1.736,"After money got involved,"
"00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:24,676",2.812,"he treated me like some headache, but I put up with it."
"00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:29,225",3.061,"Whenever he was annoyed, it felt like it was all my fault."
"00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,071",2.771,I felt guilty asking him to pay me back.
"00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:37,082",2.936,It feels like it's my fault for getting myself in this situation.
"00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,729",1.489,That's just who I am.
"00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:44,071",2.936,I can never understand those who help women divorce
"00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:46,841",2.688,and rip off their problematic husbands.
"00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,944",1.324,Just leave me be.
"00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:54,078",3.183,"Even if I look like an idiot, just leave me be."
"00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:55,981",1.819,Don't try to help me unless I ask you.
"00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:00,778",2.853,People like me can't see things to an end with people the way you want.
"00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:05,038",2.440,Even fighting with someone is hard for me.
"00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,602",2.482,So how can you expect me to fight him to the end?
"00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,632",2.399,You don't seem to have a problem fighting with me.
"00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:18,023",0.827,Because…
"00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,091",1.282,you like me.
"00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,648",2.399,You can do anything in front of someone who likes you.
"00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,107",1.076,That's why
"00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,167",2.316,you should worship an idiot like me.
"00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,889",2.895,So I can get so confident that I might even come to love myself
"00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,066",3.556,and be able to tell that bastard everything I want to say.
"00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,003",1.903,I want you to make me that person.
"00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,476",2.357,Someone who doesn't worry about other people knowing
"00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,834",2.275,and doesn't care what others think.
"00:52:01,653 --> 00:52:02,935",1.282,So worship me.
"00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,162",0.910,Eat.
"00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,189",1.324,You were trembling.
"00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:43,091",1.034,Come eat.
"00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:51,279",1.282,This is me worshiping you.
"00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,057",0.827,Come eat.
"00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:09,103",0.992,Water.
"00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:43,428",2.812,You'll be surprised if you find out what kind of person I am.
"00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,868",0.868,You know?
"00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:51,616",1.571,I'm a scary person.
"00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,338",2.357,I won't even blink if I was stabbed in the stomach.
"00:53:58,523 --> 00:53:59,598",1.075,But…
"00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:02,782",1.323,you scare me.
"00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:07,331",2.109,I get nervous when you're in front of me.
"00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,557",2.150,And that annoys me because it makes me feel like an idiot.
"00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:14,651",1.406,But even though it annoys me…
"00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,753",1.200,I still wait for you.
"00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:21,516",0.869,Okay?
"00:54:23,584 --> 00:54:25,032",1.448,"You should know,"
"00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:26,727",0.910,Yeom Mi-jeong.
"00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,829",1.530,You should know who you are.
"00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,814",2.233,Keep going. I like it.
"00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:27,477",1.116,They're strays.
"00:55:28,883 --> 00:55:30,331",1.448,Seems like they were abandoned.
"00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:35,665",3.721,They must think it's safe there since it's an open area.
"00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,403",1.654,They sleep there even when it rains.
"00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:40,959",1.613,They must have had owners once.
"00:55:51,753 --> 00:55:55,144",3.391,Don't go near them. It's better not to get close to a barking dog.
"00:56:06,475 --> 00:56:07,426",0.951,You got this.
"00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:29,014",3.846,Why are my emotions like this?
"00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:31,785",2.688,They just do whatever they want.
"00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:35,382",2.315,"Nothing's happened, but they're just…"
"00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:37,988",1.282,Does it make sense?
"00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:42,082",2.067,This isn't in my control.
"00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:43,819",1.655,Something must be broken.
"00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,289",0.950,It's fine.
"00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:57,218",3.060,"I may fall in love easily, but I can hate people just as easily."
"00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:59,865",2.564,I fall in love in the morning and hate them by the evening.
"00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,601",1.653,"One day, I'll be like this again,"
"00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,414",2.729,"""That was close. I'm so glad nothing happened."""
"00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:10,038",3.556,The day I feel nothing will come. It'll be like I never liked anyone.
"00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:17,855",1.366,Which one do you prefer?
"00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:20,956",2.398,"Having no emotions just like before,"
"00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:23,437",1.943,or being frustrated since you like somebody?
"00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:28,565",1.406,Damn it.
"00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:32,577",2.812,This is driving me nuts.
"00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:35,886",2.441,Why don't you just tell him?
"00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,525",2.317,Nicely and politely.
"00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:44,156",0.951,I don't think I can.
"00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:46,803",1.365,Why not?
"00:57:55,653 --> 00:57:58,259",2.606,"But how will she, knowing what she's done in her life?"
"00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:03,138",4.342,She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone because they told her they liked her.
"00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:05,123",1.902,So how can she tell anyone she likes them?
"00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:07,977",2.771,Maybe the guy will end up shooting her dead.
"00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,857",4.218,She treated a guy who liked her so badly because he was below her standard.
"00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,330",2.770,She must be scared to be treated that way.
"00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,301",2.316,There are so many people like me.
"00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:33,162",1.778,I'm not the only one.
"00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:37,628",2.522,But why does it feel like I'm the only one?
"00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:58,637",6.369,Please stay beside me
"00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:05,005",5.417,Please don't leave me
"00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,570",2.357,It's been a while since I had a good cry.
"00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,278",1.613,I'm so sorry.
"00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:50,951",2.564,I was arrogant and rude.
"00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:55,293",4.260,"To those people who got cursed at for telling me their feelings,"
"00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:57,527",2.151,I'm sincerely praying for forgiveness.
"00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:59,470",1.861,I was wrong.
"00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:01,414",1.861,I'm so sorry.
"01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,722",3.225,"If you still have a scar on your heart,"
"01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:07,948",3.143,I pray that it will be healed tonight.
"01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:12,001",3.474,I sincerely wish for your happiness.
"01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,407",1.323,Thank you.
"01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,722",2.232,Thank you so much for ever liking someone like me.
"01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:16,674",0.868,Thank you.
"01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:20,727",3.970,Thank you. I hope you can forgive me for everything.
"01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:30,445",1.406,I'll get going.
"01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:37,186",0.868,See you later.
"01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:54,762",1.034,See you later.
