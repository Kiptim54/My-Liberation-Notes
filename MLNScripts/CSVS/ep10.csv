"00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,257",2.586,He must want to get rid of us and keep it all to himself.

"00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,099",2.419,This isn't exactly high-quality either.
"00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,433",1.251,Go on and eat.
"00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,484",3.712,What's the best way to enjoy it then?

"00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,575",2.461,This type of meat
"00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,703",3.045,tastes best with just a little bit of wasabi.
"00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,998",2.086,Just a little bit of wasabi.
"00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,606",3.170,"I said I'd treat you to a nice meal, but you want cold noodles?"

"00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,068",1.459,That's what I want to eat.

"00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,312",2.586,Then he comes and trashes my place like that.
"00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,564",2.169,He completely ruined my wallpaper.
"00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,317",2.669,The most expensive thing in my house is the wallpaper.
"00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,111",2.711,"If it gets dirty, I have to pay 500,000 won when I move out."
"00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738",1.084,"It's 500,000 won."
"00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,949",2.128,"Hey jerk, you better wire me the money."
"00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,952",2.253,You'd better. Before I sue you.
"00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580",1.501,So how would you score this guy?
"00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,169",2.628,About 15 points?
"00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,671",0.918,He wasn't bad.
"00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,050",2.628,But I think 15 is too generous.
"00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,219",2.086,He's violent and he cheated on you.
"00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,472",1.210,Well…
"00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,516",1.293,He didn't make excuses.
"00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018",1.793,"When he cheated and got caught,"
"00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,437",2.335,he panicked for a second and apologized right away.
"00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,525",3.504,It's like he becomes stupid when he gets caught doing something bad.
"00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694",1.544,Like a puppy that made a mess.
"00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,197",2.920,There are a lot of crazy jerks who do bad things
"00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,532",1.252,and blame you for it.
"00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,246",1.251,"So, Mi-jeong,"
"00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,331",1.418,What's your boyfriend's score?
"00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,629",3.462,I guess he's at least above 15 since he doesn't make excuses either.
"00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,965",0.834,And?
"00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,389",1.919,And? What else?
"00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,602",1.751,You'll be surprised if you see him.
"00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,271",1.585,You might think he's homeless.
"00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566",1.669,He must be one hell of a guy.
"00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,788",1.168,Am I scary?
"00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,794",1.710,He says I scare him.
"00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,050",3.254,I guess you see right through him.
"00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,763",1.168,Just tell him to grovel.
"00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,932",1.793,You should grovel when you're scared.
"00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,144",3.128,But they always want to run away.
"00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,774",1.627,He does have some problems.
"00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574",2.377,Since when did we care about that?
"00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951",1.793,"Even with the same person,"
"00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,747",2.795,"you can name a thousand reasons to love them,"
"00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,250",2.627,and a thousand reasons not to.
"00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,795",1.168,Look at Chang-hee.
"00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,423",3.086,"He hates Jeong A-reum so much, even for wearing circle lenses."
"00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966",1.459,"I wear them too, you know."
"00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,598",4.171,Wearing circle lenses could be one of the thousand reasons to love me
"00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,685",3.461,and one of the thousand reasons to hate Jeong A-reum.
"00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,897",1.877,There's no reason.
"00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,233",1.627,You just love
"00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819",1.919,or hate someone because you want to.
"00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,625",0.834,Hey.
"00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,545",0.876,"Here, it's alcohol."
"00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,964",1.877,It's really good.
"00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,633",2.586,"I want to give it to Gu, but I'm going to be late tonight."
"00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,097",2.378,Make sure to tell him it's from me!
"00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,986",3.170,My sister is on her way home. I'll have to take the train.
"00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,907",2.919,Why don't you go home with your brother then?
"00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,869",2.878,I don't take a cab with that brat alone. It's gross.
"00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,831",2.419,"Why do you always call it the train, Ms. Yeom?"
"00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,252",1.168,Like an old person.
"00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,465",2.293,What else should I call it then?
"00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,344",3.044,Doesn't everyone call it the subway?
"00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,096",1.668,It doesn't run underground in Gyeonggi.
"00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,974",2.794,Why would they dig up the ground? The land is mostly empty.
"00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,727",2.044,Don't make it so obvious you live in Gyeonggi.
"00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729",1.919,Just call it the subway.
"00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399",1.376,I do live in Gyeonggi.
"00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,163",0.918,Hello?
"00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,750",1.961,What are you up to? Are you off work?
"00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,044",1.001,Yes.
"00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,129",1.460,Are you on your way home?
"00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,465",2.252,"No, I'm having a drink with my colleagues."
"00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,467",0.918,Where?
"00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,844",1.251,It's close by.
"00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305",1.668,Want some octopus? You like octopus.
"00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,601",3.712,She's the one who wants it. She's just trying to use someone else as an excuse.
"00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,727",1.043,Don't you?
"00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,606",3.295,Just tell them you're leaving and join us here. It's fresh.
"00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,691",2.002,"Tae-hun owes you a meal anyway, right?"
"00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,280",2.544,Come on. My sister cooks octopus very well.
"00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,867",3.503,Come and let's enjoy its sweetness together.
"00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,582",3.045,Start cooking. Gi-jeong says she'll come. And he'll pay.
"00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,336",2.336,"I was going to take her to a nice place, not here."
"00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,422",3.003,Octopus is more than what she deserves for what she did.
"00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,008",2.502,She just picked up a record for you.
"00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,178",2.336,This is his treat.
"00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,730",2.294,I'm just trying to get your sales up.
"00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,328",0.834,What's the matter?
"00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,207",2.294,I've just been invited over for a meal.
"00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750",0.917,By that guy?
"00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,714",0.835,No.
"00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,426",2.753,"By my friend, his sister."
"00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,265",4.421,She called and said he'd buy me the meal he said he would tonight.
"00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,727",2.086,I'm not sure if I should go or not.
"00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,573",0.834,Hello?
"00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,577",2.962,Gyeong-seon called you without asking me
"00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,331",3.671,because she wants to eat octopus.
"00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,583",1.418,So don't worry about it.
"00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,842",2.878,Should I not come then?
"00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,680",3.128,I just thought it was rude to invite you so abruptly.
"00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,058",1.752,I wanted to take you to a nice place.
"00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351",1.584,"I mean, it's my place, so…"
"00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,898",2.586,"You mean, your home upstairs?"
"00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,399",0.834,<i>No.</i>
"00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443",1.126,My sister's bar.
"00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,074",1.919,"Well, I don't mind."
"00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,164",1.710,I have to go. Bye.
"00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,546",1.209,"It's close to here, right?"
"00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,549",2.919,"Yes. It's behind the food alley, three minutes away."
"00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886",3.253,"Oh, Gosh. Three minutes. It's so close. I'm nervous."
"00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,348",3.379,Don't rush. Take your time.
"00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,522",3.254,I'm about to cross another mountain now.
"00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,483",2.878,My first encounter with the guy who rejected me.
"00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859",1.293,You can do this.
"00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,361",0.918,I can do this.
"00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008",1.459,I don't like that lady.
"00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,761",2.044,Why not? She's my friend.
"00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,642",1.710,Is that why you don't like her?
"00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,001",0.876,Welcome.
"00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,511",1.334,Hello.
"00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,897",1.127,You're here.
"00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,024",1.168,Hello.
"00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,777",3.670,"Sit, you came on a good day since there are no customers. Let's have a drink."
"00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,070",1.209,Sure.
"00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,578",1.460,Please have a seat.
"00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,330",0.876,Okay.
"00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,503",1.251,Where's Gyeong-seon?
"00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,423",1.126,She'll be down soon.
"00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758",1.252,I see.
"00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,261",2.210,Did you have dinner?
"00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,764",0.918,Yes.
"00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,311",2.836,What would you like to drink?
"00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,480",1.251,Beer.
"00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,191",1.877,"And a bottle of soju, please."
"00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,277",1.960,-You want to mix them? -Yes.
"00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,029",1.043,Sure.
"00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,293",2.377,I wanted to take you to a nice place.
"00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,171",1.543,This place is nice too.
"00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,341",1.376,I also like octopus.
"00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,192",1.084,All right.
"00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195",1.335,Should I mix them for you?
"00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,032",1.710,-Sure. -Right.
"00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,511",3.211,"I get tipsy really quickly, you know."
"00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,016",3.879,"So when I drink soju bombs, I get all hyped up in ten minutes."
"00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,445",3.379,I really was going to take you to a nice place.
"00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,240",2.044,"This place is nice, really."
"00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,541",1.209,Bottoms up?
"00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,959",0.834,Okay.
"00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:24,142",5.464,"In exactly ten minutes, I'll be all hyped up and chatty."
"00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,103",0.959,Ten minutes?
"00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,482",2.503,"Well, that is fast."
"00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,659",0.834,Thank you.
"00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,749",1.543,I mean it.
"00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,213",3.629,I tried to cross a mountain.
"00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,010",2.502,"Thanks to you, I was able to cross it."
"00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,309",3.086,"I mean, there was this mountain in front of me."
"00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,105",1.627,And crossing it
"00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,358",2.461,has given me courage.
"00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,947",3.295,Now I want to face the mountains one by one
"00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,491",1.794,instead of avoiding them.
"00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452",0.834,So today…
"00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:31,459",4.755,I came here to get over the embarrassment--
"00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294",1.751,Why are you embarrassed?
"00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,631",2.377,I'm treating you to thank you for the favor.
"00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,261",1.210,Thank you
"00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,221",1.084,for coming.
"00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:10,248",4.963,All right. I've had two soju bombs. I'll become really energized now.
"00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,364",1.334,It's from my brother.
"00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,793",2.086,It's not some excuse I made up.
"00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045",1.669,He really asked me.
"00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,131",0.876,I know.
"00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,675",1.209,He texted me.
"00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,400",1.418,Don't you have anything to say?
"00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,324",1.084,That's a surprise.
"00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,453",2.419,You just sounded like one of those dull women.
"00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,250",0.918,What?
"00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,378",1.293,Do you want me to apologize?
"00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,007",1.710,"If you have something to say, say it."
"00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,430",5.130,Women always ask for things like I owe them something.
"00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,932",1.418,"I don't owe you anything, do I?"
"00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,568",1.127,That's how life is.
"00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,280",2.294,It seems to go well and then stabs you in the back.
"00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,743",2.210,Did you think it was always going to be peachy?
"00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,623",0.834,Idiot.
"00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088",1.668,It's not like I asked for a diamond.
"00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,216",1.710,It'd be easier to get you a diamond.
"00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,719",1.293,How do you worship someone?
"00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,304",0.960,I have no idea.
"00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,434",2.753,You were ready to let a dog bite off your arm.
"00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,145",1.961,"And yet, you find it hard to hold a woman?"
"00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,650",3.086,"You think it's cool to endure pain with clenched teeth,"
"00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,487",3.044,"and it's dull to have a cute, happy life with a woman?"
"00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,657",1.460,Which is harder?
"00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,703",3.045,"Getting your arm bitten off by a dog and getting your nose broken,"
"00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,580",1.794,or being nice to the woman you like?
"00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707",1.502,Which do you think is harder?
"00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,547",3.295,You treated me like a fool who couldn't even get her money back.
"00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758",1.001,You're no better.
"00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,178",2.210,You went to Sanpo Middle School?
"00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,806",2.545,"Yes, I finished middle school in Sanpo."
"00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,767",2.878,"Do you know Yeom Chang-hee, by any chance?"
"00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,895",3.045,He's my younger brother. He went to Sanpo Middle School too.
"00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,605",1.626,-Really? -Yes.
"00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941",1.001,You're his senior.
"00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,361",2.419,He actually works near here as well.
"00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,530",2.086,He's probably drinking somewhere around here.
"00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,949",2.336,"-You should ask him to come. -No. God, no."
"00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,909",1.877,I'd never. I'm sick of him.
"00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,454",0.917,Hello.
"00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001",1.460,What took you so long?
"00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,632",1.835,"Hey, the octopus tastes great."
"00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,717",1.001,Come have a seat.
"00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,885",2.085,-You were dying to eat it. -Yes.
"00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,610",0.875,What?
"00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,203",1.293,What happened to your hand?
"00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874",1.168,This?
"00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,418",1.710,I got hurt.
"00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,262",4.713,"Hey, divorced dad. Unless you want to be shot dead, go get me some beer."
"00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,642",1.626,Watch what you say.
"00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,937",1.668,"Watch what you say,"
"00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,315",1.543,or my sister will kick your ass.
"00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,988",1.418,What's with you?
"00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,077",1.168,She's my guest.
"00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,664",1.418,It was…
"00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,628",3.254,Yu-rim's birthday that day.
"00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,300",2.085,We didn't know each other then.
"00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,179",3.212,"Yu-rim and I were just having dinner, and we happened to overhear her."
"00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,266",3.461,"She apologized many times afterward. She wanted to apologize to Yu-rim too,"
"00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,644",1.543,but I told her not to.
"00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,986",1.668,"Oh, no! The stove!"
"00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531",1.418,I really left the stove on.
"00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,481",1.835,"Hui-seon, I'm sorry."
"00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,237",1.126,I'm sorry.
"00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,117",3.379,You don't have to apologize anymore.
"00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,998",3.504,Right. She didn't know any better then.
"00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,544",2.169,It's okay. Let's just drink.
"00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,509",1.418,Hui-seon and I are
"00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,055",3.587,going to take care of Yu-rim for the rest of our lives and then die.
"00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:28,311",5.172,Her mom made another family with another man and had…
"00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317",1.752,Had another child.
"00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,570",3.170,We'll never let her feel betrayed and hurt like that ever again.
"00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:44,202",6.549,We're not going to give our affection to anyone else until the day we die.
"00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,706",4.421,We're going to die after loving and cherishing just Yu-rim alone.
"00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624",0.835,That is
"00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,418",1.668,the only reason why I'm still alive.
"00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,715",1.627,But he won't die single like us.
"00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,092",1.042,He's seeing a woman.
"00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,638",0.960,"I told you, I'm not."
"00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,766",1.043,I don't have anyone.
"00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,564",1.043,I don't.
"00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,025",1.126,I really don't.
"00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,613",3.212,What was that? Why are you so concerned about what she thinks?
"00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868",0.834,What's going on?
"00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913",1.585,Do you have feelings for Gi-jeong?
"00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,795",1.001,I…
"00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,049",1.335,"told him I liked him,"
"00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,636",1.168,and he rejected me.
"00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,231",0.834,Yu-rim.
"00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,858",1.584,We won!
"00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,113",3.087,A very nice play from Cho Tae-hun!
"00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,115",1.919,For God's sake.
"00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,033",1.835,"-We need to talk. -No way, you prick."
"00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,285",1.168,Hey!
"00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,161",1.251,"No thanks, brother."
"00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,247",0.834,Where's Chang-hee?
"00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,417",2.503,He went to the district office. He'll be here soon.
"00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,086",2.586,A-reum's father apparently keeps giving him errands.
"00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,965",3.003,He should take care of his own business with the district office.
"00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,217",2.168,Does he think the HQ employees are his butlers?
"00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,681",1.460,Just between you and me.
"00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,768",2.503,"I'm trying to separate A-reum and Chang-hee,"
"00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,021",3.170,but no one wants to take A-reum.
"00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,316",2.628,"So I'm thinking, how about you and Chang-hee switch teams?"
"00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,945",0.834,You want me
"00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,573",1.376,to sit next to A-reum?
"00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:28,991",0.834,Yes.
"00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,578",1.043,Gosh.
"00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,914",1.043,What?
"00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,499",1.502,It could be different with you.
"00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,500",0.918,Why don't we
"00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,127",1.376,wait and see for a while?
"00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,296",2.085,Chang-hee seems okay these days.
"00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,300",3.378,He didn't even complain about going to the district office. He was smiling.
"00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,637",3.253,"I mean, he used to throw a tantrum over things like that."
"00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,307",3.003,"But today, he just smiled and said, ""I'll see you later."""
"00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,851",1.626,"He does seem different, doesn't he?"
"00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,104",1.001,Is he dating someone?
"00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,690",1.960,I don't think so.
"00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,318",1.126,-Here. -Hey.
"00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445",1.293,"Man, it's hot."
"00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,906",1.835,I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
"00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,449",1.460,"No, I just got here."
"00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,577",1.793,Look at you.
"00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,163",2.502,-I'm okay. -What do you want to eat?
"00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,041",1.960,I'll just have the ox bone soup.
"00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,876",0.834,You?
"00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,503",0.834,Same.
"00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090",2.836,"-Excuse me. Three ox bone soup, please. -Where's the cup?"
"00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,261",1.418,What is it?
"00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973",1.502,It can't be a girl.
"00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,061",1.293,You're not going to tell me?
"00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,570",1.293,"A few days ago,"
"00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,489",1.668,I almost died trying to hold in my poop.
"00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,743",3.003,It was right about to come out so I had to barge into my neighbor's house.
"00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,287",1.460,The guy who works for your dad?
"00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,122",1.752,-Yes. -The one that jumped that long distance?
"00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,791",2.586,Yes! It was so freaking cool.
"00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,627",2.752,"I didn't even have time to turn the lights on,"
"00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421",1.710,but the power was out anyway.
"00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,426",1.460,"<i>So I was sitting in the dark,</i>"
"00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,305",3.796,<i>and I saw something glimmering next to my butt.</i>
"00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,891",1.252,<i>It was a bidet.</i>
"00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,935",2.043,"<i>I thought, ""This guy uses a bidet.""</i>"
"00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,522",2.878,"<i>""Of course. I'm sure he used to be rich.""</i>"
"00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,777",4.629,<i>He seemed like a guy who used to be rich. I just had the feeling.</i>
"00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,573",2.669,<i>Then I saw something else in front of me.</i>
"00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,992",1.835,"<i>I was like, ""Is it a glowing watch?""</i>"
"00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:41,540",4.921,"<i>No, it was a key to a Royce, my dream car.</i>"
"00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,585",1.168,"<i>The moment I saw it,</i>"
"00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,463",2.336,<i>I could picture his past at once.</i>
"00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,632",1.669,<i>A man who fell from the very top.</i>
"00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,968",3.253,<i>A man who doesn't care where he puts the key to his luxury car.</i>
"00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,429",2.377,<i>My savior.</i>
"00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,605",3.879,"I don't know why, but I wanted to get close to him. I just did."
"00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,357",1.669,It's like my soul knew.
"00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,567",1.626,"""Cling to him. Grovel, Chang-hee."""
"00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,361",1.126,And I really groveled.
"00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,947",1.961,"Well, you know I'm good at it."
"00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,325",2.753,"But to him, I just shut up and groveled."
"00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,827",2.419,"I don't know his age, but I treat him like he's older."
"00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,205",1.835,How great are my animal instincts?
"00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,547",2.837,"He likes me too, you know."
"00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,215",1.001,If I go…
"00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,384",0.876,"""Hey."""
"00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:39,139",4.921,"""Your car that you just ditched somewhere. Can I drive it?"""
"00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,392",1.502,He'll let me.
"00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,310",1.293,I'm 100 percent sure.
"00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,318",1.668,What if he only has the key?
"00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,000",4.130,"You want to ruin it, right? Okay, I get it."
"00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,218",3.795,"<i>Since that day, what A-reum says doesn't bother me anymore.</i>"
"00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,931",3.920,<i>She's just too trivial to ruin my saintly mood.</i>
"00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,852",3.170,"<i>I've tried everything to not hate her. Meditation, Buddhist chants…</i>"
"00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,061",1.126,<i>None of them worked.</i>
"00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,316",3.754,"<i>I thought, ""When you hate someone, you just can't help it.""</i>"
"00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,444",2.419,<i>But what I needed was something beyond mere willpower.</i>
"00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,621",3.879,<i>I use his bathroom every morning and night to check on the key.</i>
"00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,965",1.960,Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.
"00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,302",1.126,What?
"00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,973",1.043,"It's good, isn't it?"
"00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,564",0.959,"Good night, then."
"00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,281",3.003,<i>I hope he and Mi-jeong make up soon so I can bring it up.</i>

"00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328",1.209,<i>So what's the big deal?</i>
"00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,168",2.294,<i>I still think you're okay.</i>
"00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,504",1.335,<i>So let's carry on.</i>
"00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,339",1.335,<i>Let's keep going.</i>
"00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,436",1.544,VILLAGE BUS STOP SANPO
"00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,728",1.209,<i>It's now chilly…</i>
"00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,315",1.543,<i>in the morning.</i>
"00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,261",3.962,I don't get why you'd ask a man for dating advice.
"00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,432",4.088,Shouldn't you ask another woman for that sort of thing?
"00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,480",5.131,"To me, it looks like an excuse to make a move on him."
"00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,859",1.376,Am I overreacting here?
"00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,195",1.544,"No, you're not."
"00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,697",0.876,I'm sorry.
"00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,117",2.294,You're absolutely right. I don't know what to say.
"00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369",1.459,I'm so embarrassed.
"00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,080",2.627,Please try to understand how it makes me feel.
"00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,209",3.045,"Because you and Mr. Park seem so close,"
"00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,337",3.045,people are starting to wonder if he and I have broken up.
"00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,173",0.876,I'm really sorry.
"00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050",1.085,I'll be careful.

"00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,692",2.043,Why are you crying?
"00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,861",2.085,Now you're making me feel bad.
"00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,404",1.459,"No, I…"
"00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,407",1.876,I'm just so ashamed of myself.
"00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,536",2.461,I just embarrass myself every day.
"00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,046",2.961,But you have nothing to worry about though.
"00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,173",1.543,I'm not Mr. Park's type.
"00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,426",2.127,He didn't even give me any lottery tickets.
"00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,886",0.876,That's right.
"00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,362",2.878,What did Ms. Yeom say?

"00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,433",2.628,You two seem to be very interested in your looks.
