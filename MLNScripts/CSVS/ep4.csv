"00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:41,316",2.752,"Here. Help yourself as much as you want, okay?"
"00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,110",0.876,Go on.
"00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,490",0.876,I'm done.
"00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,086",1.251,I've never heard that man
"00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,590",3.421,compliment anyone on the job. Not even once.
"00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,466",1.793,But he loves you.
"00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,095",3.545,He says you're a good worker and that you'd be good at anything.
"00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:14,600",3.421,I've never heard him compliment anyone other than Mi-jeong.
"00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,520",2.628,"She's always been his favorite, you know."
"00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,857",3.253,"He always glares at me when he sees the drawers I make,"
"00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,359",1.918,but he never complains about her work.
"00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:29,865",4.838,She could install moldings and use every machine since she was in third grade.
"00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,284",2.336,And she was quite good.
"00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,625",5.506,Look. That's her at the workshop when she was little.
"00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,800",2.502,Her siblings would always toss their book bags
"00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,552",1.668,"and run outside after school,"
"00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,347",2.711,but she'd go to the workshop even before doing her homework.
"00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,224",1.293,I guess she found it fun.
"00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,435",2.127,"Otherwise, she wouldn't have been so into it."
"00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,520",2.002,"Hey, I need a basket!"
"00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,563",0.959,Okay!
"00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,564",0.834,Seriously.
"00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,358",1.710,Zip it until we get home.
"00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,777",2.336,I'm your only older sister. How could you?
"00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,488",1.919,"Jeez, that's enough!"
"00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,241",2.670,-What are you talking about? -Here we go again!
"00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,537",3.003,"That asshole said ""fuck"" to my face in front of everybody!"
"00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,415",2.294,"I never said anything like ""fuck""!"
"00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:02,541",1.043,I heard it!
"00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,043",2.419,"Okay, fine, I said it. I said ""fuck."""
"00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:07,170",2.043,Who brings their coffee onto a bus these days?
"00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:11,633",4.379,"There was only ice in the cup. I just couldn't find a trash can, dumbass."
"00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:15,011",3.294,Why do you wear high heels when you can't even balance yourself properly?
"00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,848",2.753,Why did you have to carry it and fall into my arms?
"00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,766",1.835,I didn't fall into your arms.
"00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,892",1.042,When did I?
"00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,602",1.626,-I was just like this. -Damn it!
"00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:23,645",0.959,-I didn't. -Jeez!
"00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,897",2.168,This is embarrassing. Cut it out and get inside.
"00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:27,983",1.001,For God's sake.
"00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,067",1.001,-Jeez. -Gosh.
"00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,654",2.794,That little bastard. How dare he glare at me like that?
"00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,826",1.043,Yeom Chang-hee.
"00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:39,619",1.084,Yeom Chang-hee.
"00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,804",2.169,"Jeez, look what you did to her."
"00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,752",1.043,"Hey, that's…"
"00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,131",2.002,That's my slipper.
"00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,807",2.670,"Seriously, why would you throw that?"
"00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,850",1.084,Jeez.
"00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,519",1.168,You go get it.
"00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:53,527",4.880,All the other kids get along with their siblings just fine.
"00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,613",2.336,So what's wrong with the kids in this house?
"00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,699",2.502,"All you ever do is yell at each other, you know that?"
"00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,036",3.253,Aren't you old enough to know how embarrassing it is?
"00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,955",1.836,I held back until I got home.
"00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,717",2.919,You've got to be careful with Mi-jeong.
"00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,177",1.376,She has a temper.
"00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,304",2.043,It's scary when she loses it.
"00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,348",1.293,"I mean, she's…"
"00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,641",1.210,How should I put this?
"00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,394",1.877,The thing about kids who can't fight is
"00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:30,021",2.544,that they don't know when to stop.
"00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,232",2.127,"Gi-jeong and I fight all the time,"
"00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,110",2.795,but we still make sure not to cross the line.
"00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,362",1.752,"But with Mi-jeong, if she gets angry,"
"00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:40,532",3.087,"she'd just kick you right off of a cliff, if you know what I mean."
"00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,952",3.337,She just doesn't think. She doesn't care about the consequences.
"00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,968",2.419,"Jeez, this is utterly exhausting."
"00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:21,197",3.712,I was really making an effort not to badmouth people.
"00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,825",2.085,"""Right, this is just where I am now."""
"00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,577",1.669,"""I'm at their level."""
"00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,748",4.088,"""When the time comes and I'm ready, I'll find myself around better people."""
"00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,750",1.919,I decided to think that way.
"00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,961",3.128,"But after a long, hard day, it's not so different at home."
"00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,270",3.670,I want to live alone and use the air-conditioner all I want.
"00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,148",1.919,Somewhere I can't hear anyone else's voice.
"00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,406",1.459,"Just like you, Gu."
"00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,408",1.168,Someone who lives alone.
"00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,749",2.836,"By the way, how did you end up moving here?"
"00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,963",3.045,No one moves into the neighborhood. People only move out.
"00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,507",2.461,Do you know someone around here?
"00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,390",0.918,No.
"00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,350",1.877,"How did you end up here, then?"
"00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,730",2.502,Did you live in the area when you were young?
"00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,817",1.293,I got off at the wrong stop.
"00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,444",0.917,Sorry?
"00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,247",2.336,That son of a…
"00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,670",4.171,Why the hell did you lock the door? There's nothing to steal in there!
"00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,965",1.460,I didn't lock it!
"00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,299",1.251,That little…
"00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,679",0.959,See you later.
"00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,981",1.251,You're just going to leave?
"00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,843",2.211,I told you to wash your hair before going to bed!
"00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,262",2.336,You two always hog the bathroom in the mornings.
"00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,439",2.419,I keep telling you we need another bathroom.
"00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,862",3.128,We won't need two bathrooms once you all move out.
"00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,201",3.003,Move out within a year. And into a place with two bathrooms!
"00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,144",2.711,ALPHA RETAIL
"00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,604",1.376,I went through the same thing.
"00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,358",3.253,So I go to the store I hate to visit the most first.
"00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,861",2.002,"When I was new, I'd visit them last."
"00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,199",3.545,But you know how uncomfortable you feel until you visit the store.
"00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:54,327",3.045,So it's better to make it your first stop of the day.
"00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:58,706",3.003,"But still, you shouldn't have said that to the store owners."
"00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,334",2.044,I didn't tell them that.
"00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:09,050",3.086,"She says she wants a different manager, but we can't just do that."
"00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:10,218",1.084,Just talk to her.
"00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,595",1.293,Have you called her?
"00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,099",2.419,She won't answer my calls or return my messages.
"00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,227",2.377,You'll just have to keep trying until she does.
"00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,482",2.044,Something felt weird yesterday.
"00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,652",2.544,Every owner asked which store I went to first.
"00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,405",1.877,"I asked them why,"
"00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,031",1.543,and they said A-reum told them
"00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,701",2.586,that I always visit the person I hate the most first.
"00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,749",3.378,You should tell her to mind her own business.
"00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,086",2.336,She's not in charge of them anymore.
"00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,505",2.336,Why does she still see them and cause this trouble?
"00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,678",3.754,Do you think she's trying to keep you in check because of the promotion?
"00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,015",1.252,Damn it.
"00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,851",2.169,"Hey, it's going to be okay."
"00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:03,354",3.420,Fighting and making up with store owners is 70 percent of our job.
"00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,523",1.668,This won't affect the promotion.
"00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:08,610",3.003,I do usually go to the store I hate to visit the most first.
"00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,944",1.251,But not yesterday.
"00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,572",2.544,"The owner there works alone all night,"
"00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,659",4.004,so I went there first so she could go home early and get some rest.
"00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:41,935",1.127,Hello--
"00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,061",1.043,Thank you.
"00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:45,480",2.336,Thank you for answering my call.
"00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,068",1.752,"No, I'm not that good at acting."
"00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,529",2.961,I can't walk into a place I don't like with a smile and chat like that.
"00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,989",1.376,I can't do that.
"00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:58,785",3.712,"Honestly, it's Ms. Choi's shop that I have the hardest time dealing with."
"00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,829",2.961,"I wouldn't even be so upset if people knew, because it's true."
"00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:05,249",3.336,But this misunderstanding with you… It's just not true.

"00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,762",2.628,She wants there to be trouble. She destroys relationships.
"00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,848",2.002,I want to eat everything here.
"00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,811",1.961,I'll have this. Extra large.
"00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,562",1.042,Me too.
"00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,356",1.710,"-Two extra larges, please. -Sure."
"00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,653",3.170,A-reum talks too much. Way too much.

"00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,287",3.003,Why is a day at the office even harder than being outside?

"00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,460",2.335,It's an illness. She'll go crazy if she can't talk.
"00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:52,422",2.878,But she doesn't know that it drives me crazy. She's so selfish.
"00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:57,093",4.087,I'd rather get a call from Byeon Sang-mi than hear her babbling on. It's that bad.

"00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,975",2.169,I have to listen to exactly the same story three times.

"00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,983",2.378,And she gets upset if I don't remember any of it.

"00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,887",2.252,"God, what am I saying?"
"00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,139",2.168,I'm sorry. I'm really out of it today.
"00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,520",3.462,Take a deep breath. Slowly. Come on.
"00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,486",1.126,Once more. Slowly.
"00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:47,909",1.793,"When you're tired, take deep breaths."
"00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,911",1.918,It makes you feel a little better.
"00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,205",1.335,"You feel better, right?"
"00:28:56,751 --> 00:29:00,005",3.254,I want to shave off my hair. All of it.
"00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,343",3.336,"I mean, my hair has never made me look any better,"
"00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,971",2.544,but I hold on to it as if it's a symbol of my femininity.
"00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:12,225",3.670,I wash it and blow-dry it every morning until my arms are tired.
"00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,813",4.504,It feels like I've been struggling over something meaningless all my life.
"00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,733",2.837,"If I shave it off, I won't have any more false hopes,"
"00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:21,693",1.877,and it'll make me feel that much lighter.
"00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:24,904",1.751,"If I shave my head, will you fire me?"
"00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:28,283",1.960,I thought you said you'd love anyone this winter.
"00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,161",1.919,"If you shave your head, no one will…"
"00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,372",2.043,"Well, not right now. In winter."
"00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,916",1.751,I'm going to do at least one of them.
"00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,253",3.253,I'm so tired that I even find it annoying that I have hair.
"00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:41,713",1.376,Everything bothers me.
"00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,676",4.296,"I wish I could take apart my arms, legs, and head at night, clean them, oil them,"
"00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720",1.960,and put them back together in the morning.
"00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:53,141",2.628,That's the reason why
"00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:55,310",0.959,I never stop loving.
"00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,731",2.669,You never get tired as long as you're in love.
"00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,696",0.876,I feel embarrassed.
"00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:10,033",1.168,I'm sorry.
"00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,523",3.754,SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY
"00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,114",1.877,<i>I want to be pretty.</i>
"00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,399",0.918,What's funny?
"00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,111",1.543,I just realized something strange.
"00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,239",2.419,"When I think to myself, I speak so politely."
"00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,951",1.960,Why is Hyeon-a late?
"00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,704",1.961,It's quite windy today.
"00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,457",1.627,Perhaps there's a storm coming.
"00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,960",1.293,You've found someone…
"00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:46,963",0.918,haven't you?
"00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,175",0.835,I haven't.
"00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:51,551",0.834,"Yes, you have."
"00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,261",1.126,What do you want to eat?
"00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,180",1.293,Anything.
"00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,473",1.210,When is your vacation?
"00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,266",1.043,I haven't decided yet.
"00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,225",0.876,Why not?
"00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,810",1.501,I don't have anywhere to go.
"00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,062",1.751,I'll just save it for later.
"00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,523",1.918,All right. I'll join you then.
"00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,942",1.418,What about your part-time job?
"00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,860",0.834,I quit.
"00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:10,737",1.335,-Why? -I got fired.
"00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,700",3.170,I fought with a customer. He swore at me as soon as he sat down.
"00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:22,957",3.336,People who live in tall buildings like that must be mentally strong.
"00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,295",3.003,"They could end it all in one step, but they don't."
"00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,759",2.920,"Not because their lives are hard, but in the spur of the moment."
"00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:34,636",1.794,They can end it when they feel like it.
"00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,515",1.836,That's why I still live in a basement.
"00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,809",1.668,Basements are much safer.
"00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,022",1.543,-You want more ketchup? -Yes.
"00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:55,156",2.544,"I know it's hard, but don't think about moving out."
"00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,159",2.002,"You'll enjoy it for a while,"
"00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,286",2.043,but your life can become a mess in an instant.
"00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,541",2.878,It's so cold. I feel like my skull is going to crack open.
"00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,292",0.876,Turn it off then.
"00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,170",2.252,I can't find the remote control.
"00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,423",3.169,I can only turn it on and off. The temperature is set at 18°C.
"00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:16,844",2.460,Clean your house. You'll find it then.
"00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:31,818",3.337,I left all my nice things at that jerk's place.
"00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,947",2.336,All my pretty clothes are there too.
"00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:38,658",1.001,Go get them.
"00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,747",1.751,I don't know how to end it.
"00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,834",1.961,I haven't made up my mind yet.
"00:33:55,967 --> 00:34:00,305",4.338,We've already broken up dozens of times.
"00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,933",2.753,So why do I hit rock bottom every time we break up?
"00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,562",2.378,And why does it always feel like it's the first time?
"00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,191",1.751,Just stay with him then.
"00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,152",1.001,No.
"00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,572",2.586,There's no more love for me to give him. I used it all up.
"00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:26,706",2.669,I'm just going to keep wanting until the day I die.
"00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,794",1.668,"""Love me."""
"00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,463",1.126,"""I'll love you back."""
"00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,298",1.168,"""Love me more."""
"00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,634",1.711,"""I'll love you more too."""
"00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,803",2.294,"""I don't need any presents"
"00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,431",2.002,"or surprise events."""
"00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:48,936",4.963,"""Just give me love. I'm still hungry. Give me more."""
"00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,274",3.587,"Jeez, all the love in the world wouldn't be enough for me."
"00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,864",1.001,Mi-jeong.
"00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,867",1.585,Don't ask for love like me.
"00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,624",1.293,"You've found someone, right?"
"00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:17,632",4.338,"Just give him everything, okay? Give him everything like a warrior."
"00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,718",3.003,Just set off an explosion with your love.
"00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:28,101",4.004,Never ask for love like me.
"00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,040",2.210,"Yes, okay. I got it."
"00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,169",1.127,He's on his way now.
"00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,879",1.627,Let's hurry and finish cleaning.
"00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,880",0.918,-Okay! -Okay!
"00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,257",1.877,I wish the president visited every day.
"00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,967",1.627,You've made the store so clean.
"00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,559",1.877,INCOMING CALL STORE OWNER BYEON SANG-MI
"00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,414",0.876,Right.
"00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:15,082",0.959,Of course.
"00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:16,876",1.084,"Yes, I know."
"00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:30,139",2.377,Leave him be. It's part of his job.
"00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,895",2.127,"Okay, good night."
"00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:37,980",1.042,Hang in there.
"00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:39,732",0.834,Bye.
"00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,863",3.086,"Damn, one hour and thirteen minutes?"
"00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:12,974",0.918,Do you want seconds?
"00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,981",1.085,Look.
"00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,484",1.501,How long are you going to live?
"00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,121",1.961,How long are you going to live?
"00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:39,917",2.794,How would I know how long I'll live?
"00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,461",2.460,Kids your generation will live to 100.
"00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,840",2.628,That means you still have 60 to 70 more years to go.
"00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:47,800",1.251,What's your plan?
"00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:56,350",1.042,To live well.
"00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,689",2.419,What else can I do other than that?
"00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,318",3.546,How can you plan for 60 to 70 years? Even the government can't do that.
"00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:09,280",3.879,Then are you going to live all those years without a plan?
"00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,408",3.045,How can you possibly make plans for that long in the future?
"00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:15,786",3.295,"If I were to live 60 to 70 more years, a lot of things could happen."
"00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,581",2.711,Why should I make plans that may not even come true?
"00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,834",2.628,I hate it when people ask children about their dreams.
"00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:24,211",1.835,What dreams? Your CSAT score decides those.
"00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,548",3.253,You can't go to med school with 320 points.
"00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:31,260",3.003,You're living like that because you have no plan!
"00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:34,180",2.836,You're wasting your life listening to some woman's grievances.
"00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:45,274",3.086,Why do you spend time listening to someone else's grievances?
"00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,400",1.042,You call that work?
"00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,112",3.628,I have a colleague that's even worse. She's not that bad compared to her.
"00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,201",1.752,Let's just eat.
"00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:05,628",5.005,You keep wasting time like that because you have no plans.
"00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,844",2.502,Have you lived your life the way you planned?
"00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:19,308",3.920,You have two daughters who only make you worry and a son who never listens to you.
"00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:22,853",3.461,"You have two jobs, but you can't even afford your own car."
"00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:25,564",2.627,You have to work without air-conditioning in summer.
"00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,275",2.627,Is this the kind of life you planned for yourself?
"00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:32,822",2.336,Is it? Say something!
"00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,371",2.169,Damn it. I'm hungry.
"00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,206",1.752,I should've finished my meal.
"00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,583",1.751,Go back in and eat then.
"00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,545",0.876,Come with me.
"00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:49,296",0.834,I already ate.
"00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,548",1.168,Can't you eat more?
"00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,553",2.461,You always try to bring me home when you're in trouble.
"00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:56,470",0.834,"Go home, man."
"00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:58,472",1.168,Damn it.
"00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,481",4.588,<i>The crystal bracelet comes with a necklace and earrings.</i>
"00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,027",3.462,<i>This is an unbelievably good deal.</i>
"00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,654",2.544,<i>You can see the pattern engraved</i>
"00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,740",2.002,<i>even on the back.</i>
"00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:22,163",6.340,<i>An internationally renowned craftsman affixed them one by one by hand.</i>

"00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,710",3.295,<i>it shines so beautifully.</i>

"00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:33,799",1.668,<i>You will feel it.</i>
"00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:37,344",3.461,<i>And the surface that surrounds your wrist</i>
"00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,388",1.960,<i>is made of 14k gold.</i>

"00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,980",3.378,<i>but it would've been better if he'd passed to another player.</i>
"00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:52,860",4.796,"<i>Realistically speaking, it'll be hard to turn the tables at this point.</i>"
"00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,028",1.085,<i>That's right.</i>
"00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,573",2.961,<i>When we watch the match again…</i>

"00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,508",2.628,<i>so I think it should be a comfortable gathering.</i>
"00:42:58,384 --> 00:43:00,845",2.461,<i>Can we meet somewhere where we're not face-to-face?</i>
"00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,855",2.962,"Somehow, I feel uncomfortable when I sit across from other people."
"00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,817",1.794,Sitting face-to-face…
"00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:18,154",2.002,feels a little aggressive.
"00:43:19,572 --> 00:43:21,574",2.002,I feel like I have to fill the silences too.
"00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:26,078",2.002,Do you feel uncomfortable sitting like this?
"00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:29,498",0.876,No.
"00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:32,084",1.752,It's nice and relaxing.
"00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,463",1.501,There's nothing to it.
"00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,676",3.587,"To be liberated, I'll have to quit my job and get a divorce."
"00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,557",2.169,"I've done one of them,"
"00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:50,811",2.627,but it didn't exactly liberate me.
"00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:53,355",0.876,I'm sorry.
"00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:57,860",2.503,"There will be people who frustrate you anywhere you go,"
"00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,447",2.252,and those people will never change.
"00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,449",1.919,Then that means it's me who has to change.
"00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,036",2.294,but I don't want to let go of this anger I feel.
"00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:10,539",1.543,My anger is perfectly reasonable.
"00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:12,708",1.210,It is all too reasonable.
"00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:17,046",3.754,It's so hard to suppress this reasonable anger each time.
"00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:21,717",3.420,There are people who suck at their jobs but don't want to be criticized.
"00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,136",2.336,They call me condescending whenever I open my mouth.
"00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,806",2.961,So I tell myself to just hold it in.
"00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,477",1.460,You're doing a good job.
"00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:34,271",1.043,Does it show?

"00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,675",3.546,I've never seen people whispering while drinking at a barbecue place.
"00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:04,802",1.085,Take a look.

"00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:10,933",3.087,But after the three treatments I told you about…
"00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,185",1.043,AFTER TREATMENT
"00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:17,523",4.255,"It's the same person, but doesn't she look much younger and livelier?"

"00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,904",2.669,"you'd draw lines over here, right?"
"00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:25,823",1.835,We're getting rid of those lines.
"00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:27,116",1.210,Like this.

"00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:41,171",1.042,I see.
"00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,758",1.585,Excuse me.
"00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,010",1.168,Yes?

"00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,202",1.835,I think I saw you a few weeks ago.

"00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,205",1.668,At a barbecue restaurant in Gangnam.
"00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:17,750",1.001,What?
"00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,377",2.544,I think it was your niece's birthday.
"00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:22,546",1.043,That place?
"00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,466",2.419,Then you should've said hi. Why didn't you?
"00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,967",1.418,What?
"00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,928",2.127,How did you recognize me right away?
"00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,638",1.626,Well…
"00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:37,352",2.919,I gave you a really good price. Even I can't do it at that price.
"00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:42,649",3.670,"-You never brought a friend from Sanpo. -Yes, it's my first time meeting one."
"00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,860",1.627,We don't really talk about Sanpo.
"00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:47,279",2.336,It was a dark time for me and my two siblings.
"00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:49,823",1.960,"You know I have a younger brother, right?"
"00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,783",0.876,Yes.
"00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:53,035",2.169,You remember a lot about me.
"00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:55,079",1.961,How do you even remember that?
"00:46:56,038 --> 00:47:00,292",4.254,She recognized me straight away when she saw me on Yu-rim's birthday.
"00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,211",1.836,You should've said hi then.
"00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:03,712",1.418,Where in Sanpo do you live?
"00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,174",2.544,"Near Dangmi Station, not in the new town."
"00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,801",1.544,Near that reservoir?
"00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:10,135",1.251,Yes.
"00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:12,554",2.335,Isn't there a famous <i>sujebi</i> place around there?
"00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:14,807",0.876,"Yes, there is."
"00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,684",2.085,Our aunt used to take us there sometimes.
"00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:19,311",0.959,Is it still there?
"00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:20,395",1.001,Yes.
"00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,356",1.877,I want to go back there sometime.
"00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,900",1.960,I think of their <i>sujebi</i> from time to time.
"00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:26,860",1.376,"She called it dining-out,"
"00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,113",2.169,but it was just boring old <i>sujebi</i>.
"00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:32,074",2.878,"Still, we've gotten where we are all thanks to Auntie."
"00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,993",2.836,"Without her, we wouldn't have known about the inheritance tax,"
"00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:38,080",3.003,or how we were supposed to cough up such a large sum of money.
"00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:41,750",2.002,"We rented out the apartment on the third floor,"
"00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:45,671",3.837,"paid the inheritance tax with that money, and moved in with our aunt."
"00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:49,967",3.295,"All our relatives tried to take this building away from us, remember?"
"00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:53,846",3.170,You should know that auntie did her best to protect us.
"00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,430",1.501,Was that why the food was so horrible?
"00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:56,890",1.376,Her family ate the same food.
"00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,685",2.711,"No, they'd always go out to eat by themselves."
"00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,939",2.711,"Now that I have a niece of my own, I get it."
"00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:07,317",3.295,I find her so precious and adorable. How could she treat us like that?
"00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:11,321",2.210,"Yu-rim is little, but we weren't."
"00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:14,158",2.753,You think you'll still find her adorable when she's older?
"00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,368",2.127,Yes. I'll find her adorable forever.
"00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,208",3.628,It looks like we have a similar skin type. Those bruises won't go away quickly.
"00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:25,919",1.626,They will if you don't drink.
"00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:34,094",1.793,"-Hi, Yu-rim! -Hey."
"00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:37,598",1.377,Look at you. You're all wet.
"00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:41,727",2.795,"Hey, this is my friend from high school."
"00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:46,023",2.795,She saw us at the barbecue restaurant on Yu-rim's birthday.
"00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:56,200",1.252,"Yu-rim, did you have dinner?"
"00:48:56,992 --> 00:48:57,993",1.001,Aren't you hungry?
"00:48:58,076 --> 00:48:58,911",0.835,Yu-rim.
"00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:00,871",1.877,You'll have to excuse her. Puberty.
"00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:04,958",1.334,Kids grow up fast these days.
"00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:09,880",2.044,"-Oh, welcome! -Welcome!"
"00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:10,797",0.834,Welcome.
"00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:35,197",0.834,Hey.
"00:49:35,864 --> 00:49:38,158",2.294,"I'm sorry. I really am,"
"00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,911",2.211,but he could never get married again.
"00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,413",2.419,Cho Gyeong-seon used to be delinquent.
"00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:47,167",3.670,"Close siblings, one of whom used to be delinquent? It's over."
"00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,628",2.377,No woman would want to get in the middle of that.
"00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:52,547",2.836,I can see why he got divorced. It's so obvious.
"00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,551",2.711,"When it comes to marriage, the three of us are much better."
"00:49:56,635 --> 00:49:59,096",2.461,We'd just ignore each other outside of the house.
"00:49:59,888 --> 00:50:02,140",2.252,Three close siblings without parents?
"00:50:02,224 --> 00:50:04,309",2.085,No one wants that. Jeez.
"00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,771",1.001,Turn off the light.
"00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:11,984",2.962,"Oh, hey. Watch him closely and see if he disappears or not."
"00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:17,698",2.002,I should still get my share.
"00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:25,580",1.543,"-Here. -Oh, no. It's fine."
"00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:28,166",2.502,I told Gyeong-seon that this one was on me.
"00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,085",1.084,Well…
"00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:32,921",2.753,Let her pay. I gave her a good price for her wrinkle treatment.
"00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:36,633",1.918,She's right. Here you go.
"00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:39,511",1.793,You can just pay for the drinks then.
"00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:42,723",2.628,"No, please ring up everything, the bean sprouts and all."
"00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:44,850",1.377,I'll just ring up the drinks.
"00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:50,897",1.668,Please come again.
"00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,908",0.917,Here you go.
"00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,076",1.084,Thanks.
"00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,119",0.959,Thank you.
"00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:06,747",2.545,Here. It's a gift.
"00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,668",1.710,I'm really sorry about that day.
"00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:13,920",2.168,No. It's okay.
"00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:18,508",3.545,"Just take them. Someone gave it to me, but I'm never lucky with these."
"00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:23,680",2.544,"If you win, I'd suggest you go off the grid,"
"00:51:23,764 --> 00:51:25,140",1.376,or else I'll mooch off you.

"00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:55,504",3.921,He's Gyeong-seon's little brother. He's a single father.
"00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:00,592",0.834,Please come again.
