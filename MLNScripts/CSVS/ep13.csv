"00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:38,300",1.877,I swear I almost hit it.
"00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:43,471",4.296,"Sir, why don't we go around to check out the other side?"

"00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:03,033",2.962,I think our chatrooms have been exposed to the police.
"00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,702",1.251,So…
"00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,205",2.711,"they must've figured out how much we charge per table,"

"00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:17,881",0.876,Then…
"00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,884",2.252,we'll just have to raise the price.

"00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,394",2.002,There are quite a few unpaid bills lately.
"00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,939",2.002,By the guests or by the managers?

"00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,502",2.086,I quit gambling ages ago.
"00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,670",2.085,I really didn't do it.

"00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,537",1.919,And you have this many unpaid bills?

"00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,812",1.961,{\an8}You put them on the tab
"00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,607",2.961,{\an8}knowing they were going to ghost us?

"00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:33,279",3.503,And I don't think he likes that name very much.
"00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,907",1.502,What's your new name?
"00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,242",0.834,Don't tell me…

"00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,297",1.334,Damn it.
"00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,924",1.543,"Watch it, you bastard."
"00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:53,967",0.960,I'm sorry.

"00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,891",2.586,"Oh, this girl?"
"00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,936",2.503,She slips into a really strong dialect when she's drunk.
"00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,729",1.710,The one that came with that big girl?
"00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:12,318",3.962,Girls who are afraid of others finding out always come with the same friends.
"00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,277",0.875,That's right.
"00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,822",2.461,"They didn't look that close,"
"00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,782",1.877,but they always came together.
"00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,785",2.252,Didn't she say she works at a dermatology clinic?
"00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,539",3.003,-A cosmetics store. -Right. Cosmetics.

"00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,584",2.210,It was an old neighborhood.
"00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,046",2.085,"Right. A department store in Myeong-dong, sir."
"00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,923",1.793,She said she worked there.
"00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:54,652",4.171,<i>I'll show you how I became a manager in just two weeks and the boss in a year.</i>

"00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:48,065",2.878,"I think it's dinner if you eat before you go to bed,"
"00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,734",2.085,and breakfast if you do after you wake up.
"00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,206",1.668,Did you eat yet?
"00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,670",3.170,The new cook's food is very good.

"00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:36,322",0.834,A baby.
"00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,242",1.251,A baby…
"00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,207",2.002,Not in a while.
"00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,377",1.543,Why do you ask?

"00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:56,967",1.293,a baby came to the club.
"00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,849",2.669,Some asshole brought his kid.
"00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,109",2.585,It must have felt as if a bird flew in.
"00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:33,587",1.001,Dig in.
"00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,853",2.627,She said you seemed to like sweet potato stems.
"00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:51,063",1.126,So she sent some.
"00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,260",1.377,"Good morning, sir."

"00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,028",1.209,I want to go home
"00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,198",1.627,"back to Naju, sir!"
"00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:23,416",2.711,I'm going home!
"00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:06,167",4.839,SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY
"00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:42,912",3.170,I took a look at what you submitted to apply for a permanent position.

"00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:57,760",2.336,You can't take credit for it. Don't you think?
"00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:04,725",4.129,I attached it because I was asked to submit everything I've worked on here.
"00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,187",3.378,"And since I also attached the new design plan,"
"00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,815",2.545,I think it shows quite clearly
"00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,275",2.377,how much my work contributed to the design.
"00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:24,161",4.087,Then tell me. How much did your work contribute to the design?
"00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,165",1.501,<i>The least he could do is help.</i>
"00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:31,794",2.920,He's terrified you might become a permanent employee. Bastard.
"00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,672",2.795,He's afraid that you might win the contest.

"00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,515",3.003,So what will you do? You'll have to see him every day.
"00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,352",1.793,Who do you think will last longer here?
"00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,148",2.335,"You've gotten cocky,"

"00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,364",1.543,We don't know that yet.
"00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,576",1.961,I'm sure you'll win.
"00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,536",1.168,Have you heard?
"00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,623",2.878,Mr. Choi is having an affair.
"00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,501",2.044,-Really? -With a girl who works here.
"00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,466",1.251,Gosh…
"00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,011",2.461,"God, I feel so cold and lonely."
"00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:24,179",2.085,Use the feelings you saved in summer.
"00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:27,016",2.753,Remember how we stored them up when it was super hot?
"00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,059",1.960,"Gosh, no."
"00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,811",1.668,I'll use them when it gets colder.
"00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,905",2.002,So-ra's grandma called earlier.
"00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:45,242",3.253,She wanted us to ask Mr. Gu what she should do with the house.
"00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:51,081",2.794,"He already paid rent for a year,"
"00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:56,712",5.547,so she wants us to ask whether she should leave it empty or if she can rent it out.
"00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:03,302",3.796,Why did he leave in such a hurry without telling his landlady?
"00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,680",1.668,It seems he's changed his number.
"00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,849",1.627,"But you're still in touch, right?"
"00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:14,355",1.710,"I don't know, either."
"00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,024",1.001,Why not?
"00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,776",1.126,Can't you reach him?
"00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:21,528",0.834,I don't try to.

"00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:13,570",1.918,Are you sure you're sick?

"00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:21,036",2.461,I said I'm not going! I'm not following you there.
"00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,205",2.086,"-Are you nuts? -I'm free to dream, aren't I?"

"00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:17,884",1.001,You're here?

"00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:11,623",2.586,Be quiet. I'm already annoyed.

"00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,612",2.336,I don't know anymore. I'll be dead meat later.

"00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,878",1.668,I think I've come
"00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,131",1.501,far enough.
"00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,093",1.543,This isn't the right path for me.
"00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,221",2.378,I don't have to force myself to keep walking on it.

"00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:37,352",1.210,As if I don't understand.

"00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,547",3.212,But I still never lost my temper or got myself into trouble.
"00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,633",3.003,They even gave me gifts. That should be enough!

"00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,767",2.920,Just because you farmed for long doesn't mean you're good at it.
"00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,061",2.211,You need to learn the know-how.
"00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:36,479",0.834,Exactly.
"00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,857",3.295,"These days, it's easy to learn things"
"00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,402",2.461,"-Yes. -Goodness, we'll be rich."
"00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,904",1.376,All right.
"00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,200",3.170,"-Dad, this is seriously awesome. -There's more here. Good."
"00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,160",1.877,"-Take a picture. -One, two, three."
"00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,705",1.836,These are seriously huge!
"00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,206",1.001,Don't!
"00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:47,759",1.585,How dare they…
"00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,472",1.502,"Fine, let's do it."
"00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,865",2.211,Let's go!
"00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:29,592",0.876,Nice!
"00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,677",2.002,"Please, don't!"
"00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,887",1.126,"Nice one, Dad!"
"00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:43,731",1.960,"We almost caught up with them, Dad!"
"00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:50,780",1.001,"Yes, let's go."
"00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,574",1.293,"Dad, step on it!"
"00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:54,700",1.042,"Step on it, Dad!"
"00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:33,447",0.834,Dad…
"00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,867",2.336,-Christ… -My goodness.
"00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,035",1.251,Be careful!
"00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:44,959",0.876,Gosh…
"00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:48,004",1.710,"-Are you okay, Mom? -You little…"
"00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,005",0.918,"Hey, what…"
"00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,715",1.627,-You should have stopped him! -Wait…
"00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,884",2.086,"-""Step on it""? You idiot! -Hang on."
"00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,594",1.627,Step on what?
"00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,179",1.502,"-Wait, Mom. -Step on what?"
"00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,685",2.377,Are the sweet potatoes really the priority right now?
"00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:08,357",1.334,"God, I can't believe it."
"00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,110",2.669,"-I can't believe it, you brat! -Stop, Mom."
"00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,361",1.168,-It hurts. -You!
"00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,121",1.752,For the love of God.
"00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:26,250",3.503,"Poor me, I have to cook even after crashing into a rice paddy."
"00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:48,105",1.209,Sell the field
"00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:50,399",2.210,whether or not you hire someone for the factory.
"00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,402",1.710,Farming is too much.
"00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:55,363",1.877,"Tending the crops that grow like crazy,"
"00:44:55,446 --> 00:44:57,657",2.211,sowing and harvesting them…
"00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,742",2.002,"God, I can't do it anymore."
"00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,289",2.878,"You just eat, put down your spoon,"
"00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:07,792",2.419,and go back out to the field or the factory.
"00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,711",2.836,But I have to follow you around
"00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:14,590",3.795,coming in and out of the house dozens of times to cook for you.
"00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:18,552",3.086,And it's not like I have any days off.
"00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,389",2.253,It's 365 days a year.
"00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,725",2.002,I had a day off when we used to go to church.
"00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,688",3.003,But you couldn't even let me have that and stopped going.
"00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,107",2.336,I'm going to start attending church again!
"00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,278",2.168,"Goodness, what's wrong with me?"
"00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,947",1.585,Why am I sweating so much?
"00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,871",1.042,Did you finish work?
"00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,958",1.919,"Well, something suddenly came up."
"00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,044",2.127,I think I'll be a bit late today.
"00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,380",1.710,Then I'll go first and wait for you.
"00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,465",1.084,Well…
"00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:58,175",1.626,I think I'll be done quite late.
"00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,262",2.461,"If it gets too late, I can just go home."
"00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,973",2.628,Don't worry about me and focus on your work. Bye.
"00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:10,104",3.253,"On days like this, just go home early!"
"00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:13,774",2.127,"You'll fall sick, dating that hard."
"00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,985",2.127,How can you go and see him every single day?
"00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:17,903",1.251,"It's close by, anyway."
"00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,507",1.543,I tried imagining it.
"00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,761",1.544,If I were your age
"00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,638",2.168,and my dad got a girlfriend…
"00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,142",1.210,I'd hate it too.
"00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,271",2.294,What would that lady have to do for me to like her?
"00:46:53,481 --> 00:46:56,317",2.836,"I'd hate it if she tried hard to get close to me,"
"00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,112",3.044,"and I'd hate it if she treated me like a thorn in her side, too."
"00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,824",3.003,I could reluctantly accept her
"00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,661",1.960,"if she were a selfless, independent woman."
"00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:14,502",3.587,"So today, I tried to look like a selfless, independent woman,"
"00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:16,003",1.418,"chattering away by myself,"
"00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,427",4.588,but all those words I said to make you accept me
"00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,014",2.169,didn't seem to work at all.
"00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,434",1.501,So I'm a bit sad.
"00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:39,693",1.209,I'm going to start crying.
"00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,452",1.001,Hi. You're back late.
"00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,413",1.376,Where's your Auntie Hui-seon?
"00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:52,581",1.084,She went to the store.
"00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:53,833",1.168,And left you here alone?
"00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:57,711",0.959,What about your dad?
"00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,213",1.418,He says he'll be late.
"00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:06,470",1.334,Why are you here every day?
"00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,556",1.502,Do we owe you money or something?
"00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:37,877",1.168,I'm not leaving.
"00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:39,879",1.460,Not until I see Tae-hun.
"00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:01,275",3.587,Think carefully. It's not easy to raise someone else's kid.
"00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,527",2.169,Even raising my own kids drives me up the wall.
"00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,864",2.795,That's because they're your own kids.
"00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,325",2.378,Do you know how much you can hate someone else's kid?
"00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,041",3.045,I didn't say we're getting married! We're just dating!
"00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,043",1.919,"Goodness me, just dating?"
"00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,794",1.668,"Once you get attached, that's it."
"00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,633",1.335,For God's sake.
"00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,594",2.878,I should have cut him off then and there.
"00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,764",2.544,He would've found someone else to marry.
"00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:36,727",4.379,Why did I feel sorry for him when he looked so down?
"00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,896",2.086,Now I'm his personal cook.
"00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,616",3.295,I'll just stop by and take a look.
"00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,287",2.961,I'll be able to tell if he's the one for you.
"00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:56,830",1.459,Forget it!
"00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,459",2.920,I can just walk past and take a quick look.
"00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,710",1.168,Before it's too late.
"00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,463",2.169,Seriously!
"00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,351",1.668,"-Yes, -Thanks."
"00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:34,201",3.879,This place used to be really small. It seems they've expanded it.
"00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,414",3.504,We used to come here a lot when I was living with my aunt.
"00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,125",2.044,I think Gyeong-seon told me.
"00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,084",0.876,Really?
"00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:03,897",2.460,I heard the <i>sujebi </i>here is really good.
"00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,983",2.002,"-Yes, it really is. -I see."
"00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:09,111",3.045,I'm reminded of how I used to have them when I was little.
"00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:11,864",2.670,"Plus, octopus is pretty healthy, I hear."
"00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:12,906",0.959,Yes.
"00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:17,870",4.880,I still have the memories of eating here when I was little.
"00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:19,913",1.042,-I see. -Yes.
"00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,966",2.669,"I ordered a seafood pancake for you, okay?"
"00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,885",1.835,And I paid the bill.
"00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,721",1.794,Enjoy your meal.
"00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:37,306",1.001,Okay.
"00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:51,153",2.669,-The food's good here. -I see.
"00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:53,530",0.834,Who…
"00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,075",1.919,"Shall I order something else, too?"
"00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,036",1.835,"No, it's fine, thank you."
"00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,258",1.042,Who was that?
"00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,846",2.377,"-My mom. -What? Gosh, your mother?"
"00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,264",1.334,No!
"00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,352",2.920,"Damn it, she was supposed to act like she didn't know me."
"00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:36,411",1.042,Hello.
"00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:40,248",3.253,Long time no see! Did you go somewhere today?
"00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:43,085",2.753,"Yes, to see someone."
"00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,587",1.627,I heard you're selling your field.
"00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,382",2.712,"Yes. Gosh, I can't do it anymore."
"00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,592",2.127,"Of course not, at your age."
"00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:52,636",1.961,You've got the factory and the chores at home.
"00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,847",3.128,"If you marry a workaholic, it's the woman who suffers."
"00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:56,765",0.834,Exactly…
"00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:58,517",1.085,Hye-suk!
"00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,060",1.460,Did you find your dog?
"00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,645",1.502,-Sorry? -Your family dog.
"00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:03,021",1.293,-Did you find it? -What?
"00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:05,065",1.960,When have we ever had a dog?
"00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,316",1.168,What?
"00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:09,236",2.378,"A while ago, I saw Mi-jeong crying her eyes out,"
"00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,239",2.920,"and when I asked her what was wrong, she said she lost her dog."
"00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,782",1.460,It was about a month ago.
"00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,836",3.003,"-Three of these, please. -Sure."
"00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,589",3.044,"If it wasn't a dog, what was it? A goat?"
"00:54:58,553 --> 00:55:00,305",1.752,Your percentage has gone up even more.
"00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,187",4.088,Yeom Mi-jeong is moving in for the final blow.
