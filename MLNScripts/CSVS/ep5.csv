"00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:15,774",1.686,DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS
"00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,924",0.834,Wait here.
"00:00:58,508 --> 00:00:59,676",1.168,I'll go.
"00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,914",2.837,I'm getting goosebumps. Why am I getting goosebumps?
"00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,334",1.919,"Gu, you're not some regular guy, are you?"
"00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,462",2.628,"You used to be a national athlete, right?"
"00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,464",0.876,"I mean, Gu…"
"00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:05,969",3.295,Why is someone like you picking peppers in the countryside?
"00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,634",1.126,Go wash up.
"00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,208",1.001,Wash up and come eat.
"00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,905",2.461,Why are you wearing a hat when we're eating?
"00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,367",2.002,They said I should avoid the sun.
"00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,704",3.336,"Good going, wasting your money just to get uglier."
"00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,728",1.418,Gosh.
"00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:06,607",3.170,"Are there this many track and field athletes with the last name ""Gu?"""
"00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,569",1.919,Can you just tell me your name?
"00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:13,865",1.001,Gu Jin-seok?
"00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,076",0.834,Gu Ja-yoon?
"00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,207",4.087,"Just wait and see. Your name must be in here, I'm telling you."
"00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,168",0.835,Gu Ja-gyeong!
"00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,170",1.001,Will you just eat?
"00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,796",0.876,Fine.
"00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,260",1.084,Gu Chang-mo?
"00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,306",1.126,Gu Chang-mo?
"00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,851",1.543,I can't believe I know Gu Chang-mo.
"00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,353",2.419,"No, that can't be."
"00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,856",2.419,"Even if I know, I should pretend I don't."
"00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,441",1.502,I don't know anything.
"00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,776",0.834,Gu Yoon-hoe?
"00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,539",1.168,Gu Bon-gyeong?
"00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,045",3.212,"You're really perfect for track and field, Gu."
"00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:14,008",4.880,"You know, those who challenge their limits all on their own usually have"
"00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,468",1.377,"a solitary side, right?"
"00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,930",2.461,What's your specialty? The 800m?
"00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:24,644",0.960,Just let me rest.
"00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,605",0.876,All right.
"00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,067",2.294,"I have nothing to say, okay?"
"00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,778",1.293,And nothing I want to hear.
"00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:36,739",1.001,Okay.
"00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,008",1.376,Where are you going?
"00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,510",1.418,To your house.
"00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,441",3.211,Thank you for thinking of us too. I feel bad.
"00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,568",1.043,How was the party?
"00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,361",1.710,"Good, everyone ate and left."
"00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,321",1.877,Your mom will be cleaning up for a while.
"00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,699",1.710,We all helped before we left.
"00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,326",2.544,I'm sure there's still a lot of work left to do.
"00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,708",1.585,Come on. Be careful.
"00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,335",1.960,Why does it have to be here? It'll be noisy.
"00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,630",2.711,How can we drink in the yard? Your dad's there.
"00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,756",1.042,My God!
"00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,010",1.085,What's with your face?
"00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,678",1.585,It's under construction.
"00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,489",1.251,"Gi-jeong, come join us!"
"00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,328",2.962,I can't drink if I want these bruises to go away!
"00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,413",1.418,What did she do to her eyes?
"00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:08,998",1.502,I have no idea.
"00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,708",1.627,What about her eyes?
"00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,545",2.836,Why didn't you bring a table or something?
"00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,005",1.376,"Just eat, dumbass."
"00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,089",1.001,My back hurts!
"00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440",1.960,"He suddenly started running,"
"00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,985",2.961,"and from that moment, it was awesome. I could just feel it."
"00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,237",2.168,"""He'll make the jump"""
"00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,697",1.376,And he did.
"00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,450",1.877,Like paper flying through the air.
"00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,285",1.752,Anyone can do that if they train.
"00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,370",1.001,You think you can?
"00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:48,788",0.835,I can.
"00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:50,665",1.252,Bullshit.
"00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,458",1.293,Care to bet? How much?
"00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,377",1.836,"If you do it within a week, 500,000 won."
"00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,545",1.585,A week isn't enough.
"00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,130",1.501,Then within a month.
"00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,883",1.460,"You won't make it, moron."
"00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,886",2.920,It was scorching today. My scalp felt as if it was melting.
"00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,056",3.087,"""So this is how I kick the bucket, picking peppers."""
"00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,518",3.379,"""Peppers, me, and the sun…"" My mind was all over the place."
"00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:14,146",3.545,But seeing Gu jump like that really blew my mind.
"00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,986",4.045,"It's a skill I would've shown off right away, but he hid it for a year."
"00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:26,450",4.754,"Someone who knows how to hide how cool he is, is a genuinely cool guy."
"00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:31,664",4.088,I knew Gu was special.
"00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,707",1.960,I could tell by his face.
"00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:38,546",2.962,How could you tell that by just his face?
"00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,005",1.376,I just can tell.
"00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,301",2.794,"A face like yours or mine says,"
"00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:48,264",3.879,"""Yes, I'm nothing special. What you see is what you get."""
"00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,557",1.210,You little…
"00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,351",2.044,We're much better off.
"00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,855",2.878,"Those who seem special but are not,"
"00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,940",2.002,they're way more disappointing.
"00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,944",3.420,We're not like that. We're just a little disappointing at first sight.
"00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,364",1.710,Take him for example.
"00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,159",2.711,"Whenever he sees a girl he doesn't know at a school reunion,"
"00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:09,785",1.543,he goes quiet and acts cool.
"00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,121",2.252,"But oddly enough, when he does that,"
"00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,290",2.086,it somehow actually looks cool.
"00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,585",3.212,So some girls are attracted to him and go on a few dates with him.
"00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,963",2.628,Then they won't even go near him. They all just avoid him.
"00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,756",1.710,"Hey, that's not true."
"00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,341",1.501,"It is true, dumbass."
"00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,844",1.877,"That habit's like a disease, man."
"00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,096",1.543,"When you first meet someone,"
"00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,516",3.336,you should act like you're nothing special to keep their expectations low
"00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,602",2.002,and show them your good points later on.
"00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:38,063",3.378,"Then you should say, ""What? You noticed that?"""
"00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:42,109",3.962,"""You're right. I can see that's my charm. I had no idea."""
"00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,403",2.210,But you're all about bluffing.
"00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,447",1.960,Then what am I supposed to do?
"00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,324",1.794,Act like you're nothing special!
"00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,825",1.418,I really am nothing special!
"00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,163",1.585,Nothing about me is special!
"00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,875",2.461,Look carefully. There must be something.
"00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,213",3.629,Ask a woman to find it for you. They'll do all the work.
"00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,759",2.711,Mi-jeong! Are you on a diet?
"00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:08,719",0.876,Yes!
"00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,430",1.960,"All right, do your best!"
"00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,849",1.710,I hope you'll get prettier.
"00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,113",2.002,Do we not have a new one?
"00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,616",2.419,"No, I've been meaning to buy one."
"00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,246",1.043,I'll go pick one up.
"00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,165",2.836,This late at night? We'll just get it tomorrow.
"00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,141",1.710,Why am I feeling sad?
"00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,187",1.418,Why am I sad?
"00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,117",1.377,He always holds back.
"00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:16,370",1.793,He takes a step forward but then stops.
"00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,708",2.920,<i>I'm just going to keep wanting until the day I die.</i>
"00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,751",1.251,Mi-jeong.
"00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:26,463",2.168,Don't ask for love like me.
"00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,472",2.502,I'm a great person.
"00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,976",2.336,I won't ask to be loved.
"00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,938",1.835,I'm a great person.
"00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,150",1.961,I won't ask to be loved.
"00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,743",2.378,I asked him what he stares at every day in the yard.
"00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:57,661",0.917,He said mountains.
"00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:03,500",3.712,"<i>He said if you piled up 7.7 billion 1-won coins, it'd be as big as that mountain.</i>"
"00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,048",1.502,Why 7.7 billion coins?
"00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,342",1.127,Don't you get it?
"00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,764",2.711,I got what he was saying right away.
"00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,849",2.002,It's 7.7 billion.
"00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,311",1.794,What about 7.7 billion?
"00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,314",1.668,"The world's population, moron."
"00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:29,777",3.921,"Let's say I'm a 1-won coin. Then 7.7 billion coins are about 5,000 tons."
"00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,111",1.251,As heavy as that mountain.
"00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,197",2.002,"If you convert the whole thing into coins,"
"00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,990",1.710,everything becomes much clearer.
"00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,742",1.668,Me and the world's population.
"00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:39,161",0.959,So?
"00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,455",1.418,Jeez.
"00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:45,459",2.961,I'm trying my best to live.
"00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:50,047",4.505,"But would you even be able to find me, just a coin, in that mountain of coins?"
"00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,302",1.501,Are they sorted by country?
"00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,888",2.502,"Hey, just forget it. Just stop."
"00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:01,475",3.503,Why wouldn't we be able to find you? We're not piled up like a mountain.
"00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,518",0.960,"That's not it, idiot!"
"00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,311",1.710,Enough about Mr. Gu!
"00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:06,772",2.377,It's just something some alcoholic said.
"00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:09,441",2.586,It must have been one hell of a long jump. Damn it.
"00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,612",1.001,Damn it.
"00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,200",2.711,How dull my life must be…
"00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,495",1.668,It's not like I saw Yuna Kim jump.
"00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,956",2.378,"It was just some guy, but I'm excited all day."
"00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:29,753",4.921,"I've never felt real joy, pleasure, or excitement in my life."
"00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:34,091",2.753,Except during the 2002 World Cup. And then it was over.
"00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:39,722",4.046,That's why I'm going on and on about it like this.
"00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,850",3.045,"As I go on about it this way,"
"00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,520",3.587,"it somehow makes me feel something similar to joy, you know?"
"00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,732",1.752,Goodness. Take this.
"00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,359",0.959,Here.
"00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,867",2.503,"You guys may have gotten older,"
"00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,078",3.128,but it's just like when you used to play house here as kids.
"00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,872",1.710,"Your bodies got bigger,"
"00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,833",2.878,but you're still the kids who used to put grass on bottle lids
"00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,418",1.502,"and serve it up saying, ""Enjoy."""
"00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:11,545",1.168,"When the time is right,"

"00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,780",2.127,So cryptocurrency is the only way.

"00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,337",3.336,Her eyes are soulless. It's suffocating to be looking at her.

"00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:16,401",2.210,The fact that she's on par with Ye-rin means
