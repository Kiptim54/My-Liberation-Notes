"00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,107",1.126,You might as well curse at me.
"00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:11,653",3.462,Then are you going to give up the store that makes you ten million per month?
"00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:14,281",2.544,"Like you said, you don't know when you're going to go."
"00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,369",1.293,I've made enough money.
"00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,706",1.502,More than enough.
"00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,251",2.377,I should pack it in while I can do it myself.
"00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,339",1.460,I'm done.
"00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,133",2.085,See if anyone wants to take over.
"00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,849",1.335,Why don't you do it?

"00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,569",1.459,"All right, bye."
"00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,951",2.670,It's 300 million for the deposit and the premium?
"00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,244",1.210,That's a really good deal.
"00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,413",1.669,They earn five million won daily.
"00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,790",2.294,And the monthly net profit is eight to ten million.
"00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,584",1.459,Just talk to your dad about it.
"00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,753",2.085,He'll have to sell his land to come up with 300 million.
"00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,965",3.128,Do you really think he'd do that to run a convenience store?
"00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,343",3.295,I already asked him once when the store in Yeoksam-dong became available.
"00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:01,138",2.711,He called me an ingrate who wants to sell our family land.
"00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:04,808",2.836,How else would we make 10 million a month with a 300-million investment?
"00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:09,146",3.212,He never listens. He won't believe me or listen to me.
"00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,856",1.126,Even if it rained money
"00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,567",2.628,"and everyone in the country started picking them up,"
"00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,652",2.002,I'm sure he'd just be working at his warehouse.
"00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:21,658",3.253,"I mean, I respect that. What else can I do?"
"00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,706",2.711,What about you? You should take over if you can.
"00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,375",1.626,You think I have 300 million?
"00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,210",1.209,Can't you take out a loan?
"00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,963",2.669,You think I have the assets to borrow 300 million with?
"00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,134",2.002,"What about your friend, Du-hwan?"
"00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,804",2.627,All he has is his house. I can't ask him to sell it.
"00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,891",1.210,This is driving me crazy.
"00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:48,018",2.044,Ten million per month is right in front of me.
"00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:53,064",3.712,How come everyone I love doesn't have any money?
"00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:01,364",3.336,Don't you ever end up loving me. Got it?
"00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,112",0.959,Han Su-jin.
"00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:42,948",0.835,Kim Ji-hui.

"00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:52,582",1.710,Nice.
"00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,584",1.334,Good going.
"00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,420",2.752,You printed out your plane tickets using the company printer?
"00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:07,597",0.834,Guam?
"00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,392",1.710,Must be nice to go on a trip to Guam.
"00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,028",0.834,"By the way,"
"00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,407",2.211,"why aren't you going along with them, Mi-jeong?"
"00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,315",1.585,"-Hyeok! -Yes, sir."
"00:11:58,398 --> 00:11:59,524",1.126,What's for lunch today?
"00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,109",1.501,How about the usual?
"00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,654",1.252,Aren't you going for lunch?
"00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,494",1.961,What do we do?
"00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,207",2.127,I'm still not going to quit.
"00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:01,586",3.879,The way people look at me when I come in and out of this building.
"00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,381",1.710,That's enough for me.
"00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,550",1.793,I used to envy people who work here.
"00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,762",2.377,"""I want to work at a place like that."""
"00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,932",2.211,And I work at that place now.
"00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,183",1.168,That's enough for me.
"00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,104",2.378,No one knows what I go through in here.
"00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:22,232",2.544,Who cares what my employee number begins with?
"00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:26,194",3.212,I'm just relieved I don't have to wear a different lanyard.
"00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:29,072",2.795,"Other companies have temps wear different colored lanyards,"
"00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,949",1.794,so it's humiliating to be seen wearing.
"00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,660",2.169,Even the nearby store owners can tell
"00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,704",1.961,whether you're a regular employee or a temp.
"00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,750",2.836,They wouldn't have invited me even if I was a regular employee.
"00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,379",1.460,Because I don't own a bikini.

"00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:40,610",1.126,Just leave them.

"00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,427",2.544,What could you practice with that alcoholic?
"00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,723",1.751,Don't say he's not an alcoholic.
"00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,976",1.710,And don't say I drink more than him.
"00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,272",1.293,Gi-jeong.
"00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:05,648",1.293,You be quiet.
"00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,203",0.876,Hey.
"00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,540",1.043,"Yes, a little."
"00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:24,959",1.502,"Yes, go wait at my place then."
"00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,462",1.918,It's going to be a while.
"00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,006",0.876,Yes.
"00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,675",1.668,There's some pizza in the freezer.
"00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,677",1.084,Yes.
"00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,681",1.794,Weren't you going to break up with him?
"00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,058",1.126,I did.
"00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,563",2.378,"Come on, don't be so square."
"00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,316",2.044,"Hey, don't hang out with her anymore."
"00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,234",1.835,You stay away from Mi-jeong from now on.
"00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,361",1.501,You've become like her.
"00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,957",1.626,"When I was dating Chan-hyeok,"
"00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,712",2.669,he said he'd quit his job and start a business of his own.
"00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,214",0.959,That made me happy.
"00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,721",2.252,Because then I could tell people that my boyfriend
"00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,307",1.085,ran his own business.
"00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,809",1.418,I thought it sounded cool.
"00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,313",0.834,"But then,"
"00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,524",1.668,"when he became very successful,"
"00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,902",1.085,it made me anxious.
"00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,113",1.460,We weren't even married yet.
"00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,329",3.629,Then hise business began dwindle because he sold defective products.
"00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,542",2.419,So I tried to be nicer to him than ever.
"00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,965",2.210,It felt like he knew I was relieved.
"00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,179",1.460,I was looking for someone
"00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:03,140",1.877,who'd make me look like a better person.
"00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,227",1.752,A boyfriend who'd make me look better.
"00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,107",1.961,"Even with all my picking and choosing,"
"00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,527",2.086,I never fully supported him.
"00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,905",2.044,"I wanted him to be more successful than I was,"
"00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,616",1.627,but not too much.
"00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:27,123",3.629,I've never given my everything to someone or vice versa.
"00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,963",1.835,I'll never do something like that again.
"00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,633",2.544,"If my partner finds success and I'm afraid of losing him,"
"00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,552",1.836,I'll gladly let him go.
"00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,637",1.543,"Even if he hits rock bottom,"
"00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,181",1.751,I won't be embarrassed of him.
"00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,725",2.460,"Even if everyone points the finger at him,"
"00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:50,104",1.752,I'll treat him as I always did
"00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,857",1.252,and just support him.
"00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:59,405",1.377,Even our own parents
"00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,283",1.961,never gave us that kind of support.
"00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,554",1.627,Why are you crying?
"00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,808",1.293,Hey.
"00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,189",2.169,Can I order chicken gizzards?
"00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,609",1.126,Go ahead.
"00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,778",1.918,"One plate of chicken gizzards, please!"
"00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,552",1.084,"Listen, Dad."
"00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,681",2.460,I'm just telling you this
"00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:11,435",3.670,because I think I'll regret it if I don't.
"00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,148",4.629,This is just a suggestion so please hear me out.
"00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,697",3.545,There's a good store that's become available. The deposit is 300 million.
"00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,659",2.878,The owner makes a net profit of eight to ten million per month.
"00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,328",1.585,He's run the store for ten years
"00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,580",2.169,so he's earned at least a billion won.
"00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,709",2.961,"If you want me to bring you the sales records to prove it, I can."
"00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,088",2.419,"Now, you might ask why the owner is quitting then."
"00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,965",1.794,He's turning 80 soon.
"00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,801",2.753,He has two kids. One lives in the U.S. and the other in Yeosu.
"00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,219",1.335,Neither can take over.
"00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,348",1.793,This is not for my sake.
"00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,851",3.420,"If you think I want to quit my job and make easy money with the store,"
"00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:53,852",0.917,that's not it.
"00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,647",2.711,It's finders keepers. It's up for grabs.
"00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,983",2.253,"Many people want this kind of information,"
"00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,820",3.754,but he asked me first because I'm the manager in charge.
"00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:07,575",3.629,"If you're interested, this is a great investment opportunity for you."
"00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:21,630",2.794,I can make a living just fine on my own.
"00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:23,757",1.084,"If you want to do it,"
"00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,386",3.003,come up with 300 million and do it yourself. I won't stop you.
"00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,400",0.834,Okay.
"00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:05,132",1.835,I'll give you the money if you want.
"00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,220",2.836,"If I divorce your dad, I'll probably get 300 million at least."
"00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:13,265",2.961,I didn't mean that I wanted to do it.
"00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,559",2.210,Everyone else makes their money grow this way.
"00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,857",1.919,Why is my family always like this?
"00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,908",1.210,Please enjoy.
"00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,576",1.585,-Thank you. -It looks delicious.
"00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,286",0.876,-Welcome. -Welcome.
"00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,206",2.253,"-Hello. -Oh, hey."
"00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,754",1.627,Where's Gyeong-seon?
"00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:44,797",0.960,She'll be late.
"00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,759",2.252,He found the remote for the air conditioner.
"00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,845",1.960,"-Wait, hold on. -Thank you."
"00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,390",2.461,He should stop rummaging. Who knows what he might find?
"00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,475",2.002,-What do you want? Beer? -That's it.
"00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:00,437",2.502,We'll have this and…
"00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,284",2.627,-Give me my beer. -Let me.
"00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:20,958",1.835,You should've asked me for it.
"00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,627",1.585,I figured you'd be tired.
"00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:27,339",3.628,I only help out on busy days. We don't get too many days like today.
"00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,133",0.876,Apologize!
"00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,135",1.919,They have fun like this. What's with them?
"00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:32,261",1.043,Look.
"00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,306",2.585,I didn't know people actually said that in everyday life.
"00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,685",2.586,"Is it just me, or does that make you uncomfortable too?"
"00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:42,104",1.376,It makes me uncomfortable too.
"00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,022",0.835,Right?
"00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:46,025",2.378,"I mean, I had this thing with a researcher at work."
"00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,693",1.585,"She said, ""Apologize."""
"00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:51,280",3.504,"My heart started pounding, and I couldn't say anything."
"00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,282",1.919,"Like, ""what did I do that was so wrong?"""
"00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:59,246",4.463,"I think it's okay to say, ""I'm offended, and what you did was wrong."""
"00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:01,957",1.501,"But when you say, ""Apologize,"""
"00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,585",2.544,it's like coming to a conclusion without even arguing
"00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,838",2.419,"that you're the victim, and they're the offender."
"00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,964",1.043,Right? Exactly.
"00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,841",1.293,"Jeez, you're right."
"00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,636",3.253,"When I heard that, it felt like I had been sentenced to death,"
"00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,182",3.462,"had fallen into a pit, and had cement poured down on me."
"00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:20,434",2.169,It felt like I was someone who deserved that
"00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,311",1.794,so I couldn't sleep at all that night.
"00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:26,648",3.545,The worst part is that I apologized to her the next day.
"00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,484",1.752,I didn't even know what I did wrong.
"00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,570",1.168,You're too nice.
"00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:35,699",3.545,That woman knows how much those words throw people off.
"00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,369",2.794,Is asking for an apology a new way of arguing with people?
"00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,829",1.376,Maybe it's like throwing the first punch.
"00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:45,626",3.462,Apologizing used to be such an awesome thing to do.
"00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,627",0.918,Right?
"00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,753",1.043,Yes.
"00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:51,465",3.629,It used to be an act of bravery
"00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:54,635",3.087,that took self-reflection and was excruciatingly painful.
"00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:57,805",1.293,I don't know when it turned
"00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,516",2.628,into such a cowardly thing that's forced upon you.
"00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,438",4.379,"You never really see those brave, touching apologies anymore."
"00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,400",3.420,It makes me quite sad.
"00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,908",3.462,"By the way, I'd like to apologize."
"00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,079",0.918,For that day.
"00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,083",2.753,You did. You even gave me ten lottery tickets.
"00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:30,337",3.670,"No, I didn't do it properly. I just glossed over it."
"00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,299",3.003,You said getting married was the best thing you'd ever done.
"00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:37,761",3.378,"And that if you hadn't, you would never have had such a lovely daughter."
"00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,264",2.419,It's been weighing on my mind for a long time.
"00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:42,724",1.960,I realized I was wrong.
"00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,102",2.294,It's such a valuable relationship to you.
"00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,730",2.919,I shouldn't have mocked it like that. I'm sorry.
"00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,816",1.418,Don't be. It's all right.
"00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,359",1.460,"No, I'm really sorry."
"00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:53,777",1.335,It's really okay.
"00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:58,240",3.837,I think I should apologize to your daughter as well.
"00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,950",1.627,"Gosh, please don't."
"00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:02,744",1.042,It'd be better not to.
"00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,873",1.669,Are you trying to heat up the beer?
"00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,792",2.210,"Jeez, what is she doing, hugging them like that?"
"00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,045",1.459,"Three draft beers, please."
"00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,589",0.918,Coming right up.
"00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,174",1.001,Okay then.
"00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:30,856",3.212,You can only date someone who scores a hundred points
"00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,400",2.461,only when you can date someone who's a zero.
"00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:36,403",2.920,You always look for someone on your level.
"00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:40,782",4.296,"Maybe 64,238? Somewhere around that."
"00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,744",2.878,"Honestly, I score 78 at the least."
"00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,913",2.086,That's what you think.
"00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,497",1.501,"No, I really would."
"00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:50,626",3.045,Just forget about the grading system.
"00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,545",2.836,"My point is, don't limit yourself."
"00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,714",2.085,You have the whole world trying to limit you.
"00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:58,717",2.920,So why would you want to do that to yourself?
"00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:01,553",1.126,You're so cute.
"00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,766",1.460,You're so adorable.
"00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,977",1.877,I'm just trying to help you.
"00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,687",1.626,Don't drink by yourself.
"00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,402",1.418,<i>I'll be home late tonight.</i>
"00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:19,279",1.793,<i>I'm having a drink with my sister.</i>
"00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,747",3.837,<i>I can't help but wait for you to text me back.</i>
"00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,626",3.045,<i>But I won't let get to me</i>
"00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:35,128",1.751,<i>and do the same to get even with you.</i>

"00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:42,386",1.752,<i>I'm done with it.</i>
"00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:56,900",3.211,<i>I love that I don't have to measure your affection.</i>
"00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,028",2.043,<i>All I need to do is worship you.</i>
"00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:02,906",1.001,<i>I love it.</i>

"00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:20,901",0.834,Hello.
"00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,878",3.795,"God. I ran into Mr. Gu on my way here, and it was so awkward."
"00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,924",2.878,I even rehearsed what I'd do if I ran into him.
"00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:46,635",2.628,But I never thought he'd suddenly show up in front of me.
"00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,678",1.459,He totally caught me off guard.
"00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:54,226",4.463,"He was getting closer, and I didn't know if I should turn my head or not."
"00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,729",3.420,Then I missed the right timing and greeted him so awkwardly.
"00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:03,944",3.295,"Well, Chang-hee told me to come over to his house yesterday,"
"00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:05,821",1.794,I was so shocked.
"00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:09,282",3.378,There was a dazzling light coming from his room.
"00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,910",1.960,I thought there was an alien in there.
"00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,996",2.085,His room was full of empty soju bottles.
"00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:19,042",3.420,"It was so hot in there too, with the sun beating down on it."
"00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:22,212",3.086,"So we tried to clean it up, but he got mad at us for it."
"00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:25,507",3.212,"Well, he didn't really flip out, but anyway…"
"00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,010",2.460,"Jeez, he got angry at us for trying to clean his room."
"00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,720",1.626,It was so embarrassing.
"00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:34,683",1.418,Did he ask for your help?
"00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,191",1.835,Did he ask you to throw them out?
"00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,822",1.710,"If not, why would you do that?"
"00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,574",1.669,Then what? I couldn't ignore it.
"00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,541",2.711,It's arrogant how you're trying to change him.
"00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:03,170",2.086,"Wait, arrogant?"
"00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:04,463",1.210,You got it all wrong.
"00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:06,923",2.377,It was an amount he couldn't throw out by himself.
"00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,593",2.586,That's also the amount of alcohol he had by himself.
"00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:10,802",1.126,And he got caught.
"00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,763",2.877,"""Got caught?"" It's not like we didn't know about it."
"00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,644",1.710,All the neighbors know.
"00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:26,860",1.043,Move over.
"00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:40,165",2.628,SANPO SINKS
"00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,792",1.167,-You got it? -Yes.
"00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,141",2.502,Wait and see. I'm going to get rid of them later.
"00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,769",2.544,Hurry up. Let's get it done while he's out.
"00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,312",1.460,Don't.
"00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,330",2.169,"Boy, she must've drunk a lot last night."
"00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,309",0.959,"Hello, sir."
"00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,395",0.834,Yes.
"00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,815",2.086,What? When?
"00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:53,029",0.917,But…
"00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:54,197",1.084,Right.
"00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,062",1.877,I got a call from the store owner.
"00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:29,274",3.128,Someone has already signed a lease contract with the landlord.
"00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,234",1.877,I think the landlord listed it for lease
"00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:33,278",1.960,when he heard the store owner was quitting.
"00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:35,822",2.461,<i>Why would he do that without even discussing it?</i>
"00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,576",2.961,Find out who signed the lease and for what kind of business.
"00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,120",1.627,<i>We can't lose that spot.</i>
"00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,079",0.876,"Yes, sir."
"00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,707",0.918,All right.
"00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,756",2.878,SANPO SINKS
"00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,853",1.376,I should've kept my distance.
"00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:09,022",1.251,I let them in too much.
"00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,909",1.585,Sometimes I'm okay with it.
"00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:26,164",0.918,But other times…
"00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,086",2.586,I hate the sight of people moving around in front of me.
"00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,966",2.836,I hate it more when they start talking.
"00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,764",3.754,I have to listen to their gibberish and have to say gibberish back to them.
"00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:46,643",1.251,What should I say?
"00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,689",2.503,It's taxing to think of what to say next.
"00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:55,652",1.168,I feel the same way.
"00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,034",3.795,"Out of the 24 hours in a day, I only feel okay"
"00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,412",1.460,for about a couple.
"00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:09,165",3.170,"And it's not like I even feel good, I just feel okay."
"00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,962",3.629,I just try to get through the rest.
"00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,094",1.794,It's been like that since I was little.
"00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,180",2.335,"When I looked at the kids running around happily,"
"00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,766",2.502,I was upset even at that young age.
"00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,644",1.877,"""What are they so happy about?"""
"00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,981",2.127,"""Why am I not happy like them?"""

"00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:47,245",4.296,I'd be perfectly okay if I only got to live 8 years instead of 80.
"00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,376",2.044,I don't do anything but I'm already exhausted.
"00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:02,552",3.253,"Still, I drag myself along,"
"00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:06,431",3.796,like driven cattle.

"00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:24,282",4.421,That's how I barely manage to drag myself
"00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:26,701",1.335,every day.
"00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:32,248",1.042,A cattle drive?
"00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:33,958",0.917,A cattle drive…
"00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,962",1.334,You must have seen it before.
"00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:40,507",1.085,A few times as a kid.
"00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,406",1.584,Ice cream?
"00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,368",1.085,I bought it
"00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,620",1.210,because I was drunk.
"00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,212",1.293,"When I'm drunk,"
"00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:22,340",2.294,I'm more human than I am when I'm sober.
"00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,141",1.126,I like that.
"00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:28,656",1.543,I didn't put it up for lease.
"00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,825",2.085,The real estate agency called me first
"00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,411",2.502,to ask if the store owner was closing down his store.
"00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:36,414",2.920,"I didn't know what they were talking about, so I asked him,"
"00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,125",2.085,and he said he really was quitting.
"00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,919",1.711,But I didn't tell the agency.
"00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:43,880",2.878,Why would I do that when I'm not the landlord?
"00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,506",1.543,It wasn't me either.
"00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,678",5.088,But they said someone who knew about it came to rent this place.
"00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:53,806",2.460,Do you know what kind of business they want to do here?
"00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,142",1.293,A convenience store.
"00:43:58,186 --> 00:43:59,812",1.626,Do you know which chain?
"00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:01,981",2.085,This chain. The same one.
"00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,612",3.087,"Apparently, their daughter works at the head office for this company."
"00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,238",1.543,She used to manage this store.
"00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:11,991",1.001,Gosh.
"00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:17,872",1.835,She came here a couple of days ago.
"00:44:18,498 --> 00:44:19,582",1.084,Damn it.
"00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,882",3.253,You could've told me at least.
"00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:35,431",4.212,I didn't know my dad would go and sign the lease right away.
"00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:39,102",3.587,"I just stopped by the store to say hi to the owner,"
"00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:41,521",2.336,and he told me he was going to quit.
"00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,939",1.335,All I told my dad was
"00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:47,193",4.171,I don't get why he's quitting when the store is doing so well.
"00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:50,029",2.753,I really didn't know he'd rent the place right away.
"00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:51,239",1.126,You didn't know?
"00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,783",1.543,Do you expect me to believe that?
"00:44:54,283 --> 00:44:56,119",1.836,His daughter works at the head office.
"00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:59,330",3.128,What kind of father signs the lease without checking with her first?
"00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:02,542",2.461,He even knew to contact the real estate agency first.
"00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,921",3.253,Do you want me to call my dad and ask? Should we all meet and talk?
"00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,549",1.085,Forget it.
"00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,218",1.668,Let's think of it as a good thing.
"00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:16,222",2.920,"It's better than losing the spot to another chain, right?"
"00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:22,311",2.335,You're making me look really bad here.
"00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:25,189",2.794,Like I pulled some dirty trick or something.
"00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,441",1.168,Darn it.

"00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,028",0.918,You're here.
"00:48:22,862 --> 00:48:24,071",1.209,What do you want to drink?
"00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,703",2.753,"Apparently, A-reum has poached three stores that way."
"00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:32,538",1.752,Her family's like a corporation.
"00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,458",2.837,The daughter gathers intel and the father calls the shots.
"00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,084",1.543,"We work at the same company,"
"00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:39,170",2.002,but she has her own business while I don't.
"00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,048",1.502,I should learn from her
"00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:43,966",1.335,but I don't want to.
"00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,177",2.127,"Even if I did, my dad wouldn't."
"00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:49,263",1.585,Let me meet her.
"00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:52,892",3.546,Jeong A-reum? I'll make her lose her ability to talk for a month.
"00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,937",2.794,She's doing that knowing that people will put up with her.
"00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:58,814",1.793,That's why she keeps doing that.
"00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:01,609",2.711,She should meet someone like me who won't tolerate it.
"00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,071",1.210,My story isn't over yet.
"00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:08,449",2.377,Fine. Let's hear what you have to say.
"00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:09,992",1.460,What did you want to brag about?
"00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:13,537",2.043,"So I went to take some cash out, all angry."
"00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,875",3.170,<i>It was like no one there knew how to use an ATM.</i>
"00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,460",1.502,<i>They were all so slow.</i>
"00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:22,505",2.294,<i>Shouldn't you use the machine just once?</i>
"00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:24,673",2.085,<i>They should line up again if they need another transaction.</i>
"00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,301",2.544,<i>But they took their time with multiple bank books.</i>
"00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,304",2.920,"<i>I thought, ""This must be how it feels to die of frustration.""</i>"
"00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,100",2.211,<i>I felt like I might lose it.</i>
"00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,768",1.585,"<i>One bad thing had happened,</i>"
"00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,104",2.253,<i>and it felt as if it was building up to something.</i>
"00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:59,708",4.087,"<i>One day, my friend got drunk and made a scene after a breakup.</i>"
"00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,628",2.836,<i>Then he got into a fight at a bar and was taken to the police.</i>
"00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:06,423",3.712,<i>And it turned out the other guy was feeling miserable that day too.</i>
"00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,300",1.793,<i>Like attracts like. It's science.</i>
"00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:11,637",3.253,<i>People who are similar always get together and cause trouble.</i>
"00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,642",1.543,<i>I knew I had to be careful.</i>
"00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,185",1.460,<i>I might meet someone</i>
"00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:22,148",3.879,<i>who also wants to beat somebody to death and get into serious trouble.</i>
"00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:23,482",1.251,<i>I had to be careful.</i>
"00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,944",3.378,<i>Then someone tapped on my shoulder.</i>
"00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:27,945",0.918,"I'm sorry, but…"
"00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,907",3.879,<i>He said his bus was arriving soon and asked if he could go first.</i>
"00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,743",2.335,<i>I guess he was taking an intercity bus or something.</i>
"00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,580",2.211,"<i>I thought, ""Here it comes.""</i>"
"00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:42,251",3.712,<i>I didn't think I could say anything nice.</i>
"00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:47,173",1.335,<i>Welcome.</i>
"00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,352",1.334,That's it?
"00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:04,106",1.043,Good job.
"00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,358",1.376,Call Jeong A-reum here.
"00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:07,610",1.168,Jeez.
"00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:09,695",0.959,We should go.
"00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,623",3.170,<i>He probably didn't want to miss his bus. He left in a hurry.</i>
"00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:22,374",1.668,<i>So I could see his bank balance.</i>
"00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,627",2.169,"INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR THE REQUESTED WITHDRAWAL OF 50,000 WON"
"00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:28,839",3.086,"<i>He couldn't withdraw 50,000 won because he didn't enough money.</i>"
"00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:34,929",1.460,<i>I was glad I let him go first.</i>
"00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:36,764",1.168,It made me feel better.
"00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,892",2.503,But it's not because I think I'm better off than he is.
"00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,268",1.293,That'd be rude.
"00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:45,689",3.795,"If you ask me if I'm the kind of jerk who takes comfort in others' misfortune,"
"00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:46,815",1.042,I am.
"00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,026",2.127,But I don't want to do that to that man.
"00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,654",1.585,"He didn't even have 50,000 won."
"00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,365",2.628,"If he missed his bus too, it would have been the worst."
"00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,075",1.627,Because I gladly let him go first…
"00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,911",1.627,"Well, maybe not gladly."
"00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:03,332",4.338,"Anyway, because I let him go first, he probably caught his bus."
"00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,792",0.876,"You see,"
"00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,837",3.128,it's amazing how I always know when it's time.
"00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:10,798",1.252,Time to back off.
"00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:15,552",4.087,"Even when I go crazy and out of control, I still get a hold of myself."
"00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:16,887",1.251,Things happen that way.
"00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,433",2.836,I think it's fate that I live like this.
"00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:23,686",1.669,I'm like a drizzle.
"00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:28,899",3.837,"I may not have a big current of my own like the river or the ocean,"
"00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:33,821",4.338,but I'm like a drizzle that soaks people without them realizing.
"00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:35,614",1.001,That's right.
"00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:37,908",2.210,I think I'll be able to afford that.
"00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:41,203",2.127,Drizzle? That's nice.
"00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,914",2.169,But don't forget about Jeong A-reum though.
"00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,834",1.669,"You brought your resume, right?"
"00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,127",1.210,-Yes. -Okay.
"00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:54,883",1.167,Hello.
"00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,137",1.085,"Oh, the girlfriend."
"00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,474",1.835,This promotion has already ended.
"00:53:02,558 --> 00:53:05,060",2.502,I keep forgetting to take it down.
"00:53:05,144 --> 00:53:08,689",3.545,You didn't need to bring a resume. You're Yeom's girlfriend.
"00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:11,108",2.336,I can't vouch for her. You have to be careful.
"00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,028",1.794,RESUME NAME: JI HYEON-A
"00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,780",2.669,"""Ji Hyeon-a."" What a pretty name."
"00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:18,449",1.001,May I?
"00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:22,328",1.001,When can you start?
"00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,871",1.460,I can start immediately.
"00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,122",1.168,-Really? -Yes.
"00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,498",1.293,That's perfect.
"00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,251",1.960,"""5885""? That should be easy to remember."
"00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:31,420",2.085,Memorize it already. I memorized yours.
"00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,674",3.086,You didn't even memorize your girlfriend's phone number?
"00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:44,308",2.252,I guess you two are okay with things like that.
"00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,189",0.960,Welcome.
"00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:54,401",2.335,All right. Let me teach you this first.
"00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:58,530",2.043,We can't take this many.
"00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:02,785",3.379,We can only take 30 bottles from each person per day.
"00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,328",1.460,This is just too many.
"00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,415",2.294,What are you going to do with all these?
"00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:23,430",1.626,Here. Thank you.
"00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,234",1.001,Hello.
"00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:41,323",0.834,Here.
"00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,619",1.168,I sold the bottles.
"00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,293",2.377,This is for your friend.
"00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,173",1.251,Thank you.
"00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,771",1.126,He really sold them all.
"00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:27,661",3.712,<i>I wonder what the man living there was doing at that time.</i>
"00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,423",1.210,<i>Probably having a drink.</i>
"00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,191",4.171,<i>I'm as happy as when I get my paycheck whenever you message me.</i>
"00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,114",0.959,Right.
"00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,325",2.127,"The number for the courier has changed, right?"
"00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:07,868",0.959,What is it again?
"00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:12,539",0.834,Hang on.
"00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,171",1.543,-Here. -Thank you.
"00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,342",1.710,Something smells nice. What is it?
"00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,259",0.834,What?
"00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,928",0.918,It's my hand cream.
"00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,514",0.835,This one.
"00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:33,977",0.834,It's lovely.
"00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,562",1.501,Right? I can get you one.
"00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:36,855",1.209,"No, it's okay."
"00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,941",2.002,It's not expensive. I'll get you one.
"00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:40,526",1.001,Try it on.
"00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,738",1.209,It smells nice.
"00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:46,532",0.960,Thanks.
"00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,657",1.877,<i>I cleaned my house for a change.</i>
"00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,909",2.169,<i>What do you think I’ll do in my clean house now?</i>
"00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,542",1.251,<i>Drink.</i>
"00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,760",0.876,Today…
"00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,972",1.918,"I worked hard to drive myself,"
"00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,850",1.460,like cattle on the range.
"00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,317",2.544,I locked myself in that room and drank all winter.
"00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,737",1.376,"When I tried to sleep,"
"00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,533",2.919,there were bottles in the middle.
"00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,871",2.711,I could've just pushed them aside
"00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,167",2.252,but I couldn't even bother to do that.
"00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:08,048",3.754,So I curled up around them like I was incubating an egg.
"00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,884",1.627,I could've just thrown them out.
"00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:19,726",3.795,But it felt as if I was walking out of my own grave.
"00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,645",1.335,Completely hopeless.
"00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,066",1.877,"Looking at the soju bottles,"
"00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,150",1.001,I thought…
"00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,696",1.669,"""I guess this is it for me."""
"00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,366",1.627,"""There's no turning back now."""
"00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,380",3.420,"Today, I did something I thought would take me forever to do."
"00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,299",1.668,I wonder if I can sleep tonight.
"01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,815",1.793,I'm not going to ask you what happened.
"01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,443",1.502,I won't ask you where you're from.
"01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:11,987",2.461,Or why you moved here and keep drinking the days away.
"01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,823",2.753,I don't care if you don't know how to write Hangul
"01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:16,450",1.544,or you don’t know your ABCs.
"01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:19,202",2.168,I won't tell you to stop drinking either.
"01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,455",2.169,And I'm not going to cling to you.
"01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,915",1.459,I'll be done once I feel whole.
"01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,296",0.834,That's cool.
"01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,057",1.127,I just worshiped you.
"01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:47,189",3.170,Why don't you keep going? I don't think that was enough.
"01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,587",1.585,How much if I jump over it?
"01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:12,464",1.293,Why would I pay you for that?
"01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:13,840",1.293,Because I'll do it.
"01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:14,925",1.001,Go ahead then.
"01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:16,635",1.210,"Jeez, seriously."
"01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,975",2.043,Can you give me some pointers before I jump?
"01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,436",0.876,Don't do it.
"01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:28,396",0.917,Why not?
"01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,733",3.253,You need to be able to run 100m in under 11 seconds to make it.
"01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:33,777",1.168,You need the momentum.
"01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,572",1.543,How about 12 seconds flat?
"01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:42,035",2.127,As if you can actually do 12 seconds.
"01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:42,994",0.875,I can!
"01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,041",2.544,I'm sure I can make it.
