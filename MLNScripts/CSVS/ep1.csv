"00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,281",1.671,DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS
"00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:21,970",0.992,Your drink is ready.
"00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,760",1.447,Thank you. Come again.
"00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:30,737",2.894,"So I joined the tango club, and I was appalled."
"00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,343",2.522,You can hear people breathing up close.
"00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,286",1.861,Why do people breathe so loudly?
"00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,347",2.192,"My boss put his hand on my shoulder,"
"00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,001",1.571,and it was hot and sweaty.
"00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,855",2.151,"In table tennis, there's sweat everywhere."
"00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,840",1.903,It just spatters everywhere.
"00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,783",1.861,"When my boss got in the elevator with me,"
"00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,892",2.026,I pulled back without even realizing it.
"00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:52,201",2.688,I can still feel all the moistness I felt on that day.
"00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,171",2.730,Sweating with your colleagues is not the way to go.
"00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,480",3.227,Musical and theater clubs are the best.
"00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:01,134",1.572,You can just enjoy the show.
"00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,904",2.275,The problem with those clubs is the meet-up after.
"00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:05,931",1.944,How you feel about the show should be up to you.
"00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,329",2.315,But they always force their opinions on you.
"00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:11,017",2.605,"If I say I enjoyed it, they say it was boring."
"00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,341",1.240,It drives me crazy.
"00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:16,477",4.054,"I mean, can't we separate the clubs into older and younger groups?"
"00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,544",1.985,Right? Can't someone suggest it?
"00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,612",1.985,Then the higher-ups will be upset.
"00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:21,522",0.827,You think?
"00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,259",1.654,What's it like in your clubs?
"00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,747",1.406,It's mostly people in their forties.
"00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,229",1.324,"How about yours, Mi-jeong?"
"00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,082",1.778,"She's not a part of any, remember?"
"00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,778",1.613,"That's right, she doesn't do any."
"00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,018",1.158,Not even one?
"00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,500",1.737,Why? They cover all the costs.
"00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,360",1.778,Many sign up for two or three of them.
"00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,553",0.993,You know…
"00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,323",1.406,I'm just not interested.
"00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,433",2.027,"Hey, you think we do it because we are?"
"00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,211",1.696,You go to have fun!
"00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,485",2.192,"And if you can get a date out of it, even better."
"00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:52,745",3.639,It takes me three seconds to realize there's no one there for me.
"00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,151",1.324,Nine times out of ten.
"00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,467",2.234,"Most of the time, seriously."
"00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,361",2.812,But there's always that one chance
"00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,678",1.738,that you might meet someone.
"00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,440",3.101,That's why it's worth going to ten different clubs.
"00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,170",1.034,Come with me today.
"00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,231",1.531,"Just come, okay?"
"00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,333",3.309,You can do it! Just one more!
"00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,152",1.736,Haven't you joined any clubs?
"00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,923",2.688,Why not? There are many good clubs.
"00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:31,825",1.323,I live quite far away.
"00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:33,190",1.282,Where do you live?
"00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,092",1.075,In Sanpo.
"00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,243",1.365,Is that by Yongin?
"00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:38,566",1.240,It's near Suwon.
"00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,040",1.530,"Good luck, sir!"
"00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,322",1.199,"You got this, boss!"
"00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:50,725",0.951,Nice!
"00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,883",1.282,Well done.
"00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,887",1.570,You can do it!
"00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,335",1.365,-You can do it! -You can do it!
"00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,614",1.654,<i>Looks like I'll be late today.</i>
"00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,321",1.655,JUNE 21ST
"00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:34,230",0.827,Let's go!
"00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,118",2.523,"Hey, I can drink more. I'm taking a cab home today."
"00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,227",2.027,-Will Mi-jeong be late too? -Yes.
"00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,836",2.440,<i>I'll be late too. Meet me at Gangnam Station at 12.</i>
"00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,392",0.909,You got this!
"00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,059",1.903,Let's just talk about it face to face.
"00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,747",2.191,Our whole relationship has been over texts.
"00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,022",2.191,Even all of our fights were through texts.
"00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:25,965",1.861,You want to break up through a text too?
"00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:30,474",4.426,"At least when we break up, I want to say it loudly right to your face."
"00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,128",1.117,I'll be waiting.
"00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,484",1.198,"I said, I'll be waiting!"
"00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,447",2.854,-Nice shot! -Nice shot!
"00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,681",0.952,<i>I'll be late too.</i>
"00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,560",1.158,<i>I'll see you then.</i>
"00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:57,644",2.730,-You're so good at bowling. -Are you sure you're not pro?
"00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,545",1.819,"Gosh, you're so good at bowling."
"00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,952",1.323,You were incredible.
"00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,854",1.819,-You were amazing. -You're really good.
"00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,095",1.158,You even got a strike.
"00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,832",1.654,How are you so cool?
"00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,230",2.315,-Everything you tossed out was a strike. -No.
"00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,979",1.737,"-I know, right? -You're so good at it."
"00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,618",1.364,I can't get my form right.
"00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,663",2.439,Are you leaving? Stay a bit longer.
"00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,318",1.034,It's late.
"00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,750",1.820,I'll head out first.
"00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,363",1.530,You're leaving already?
"00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,431",1.489,I need to catch the last train.
"00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,003",1.490,She lives far away.
"00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,739",1.117,Where was it again?
"00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,145",1.323,You should move closer.
"00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,833",2.150,Doesn't our company offer a housing subsidy?
"00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,198",1.282,It's only ten million won.
"00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,480",1.200,-That's it? -Yes.
"00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,465",1.158,"All right, cheers."
"00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,416",0.827,Where are you?
"00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,154",1.158,Hello.
"00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,560",1.323,You came pretty early.
"00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,669",2.026,It's been ages. Seeing anyone these days?
"00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,936",2.688,"Another beer glass and a pair of chopsticks, please."
"00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:15,887",0.868,Sure.
"00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,684",1.406,He asked where I lived.
"00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,241",3.060,"I said I live in Gyeonggi-do, so it didn't matter where we met in Seoul."
"00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:26,763",2.439,I told him to pick a place that worked best for him.
"00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,087",1.240,I did say that.
"00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,422",5.253,But shouldn't he at least have asked where in Gyeonggi-do I live in?
"00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,076",1.571,"But he went, ""Really?"""
"00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,854",1.695,Then he said to meet in Samcheong.
"00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,302",1.364,Can you believe that?
"00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:42,190",3.806,"Anyway, so I followed Route 1 all the way up,"
"00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:43,761",1.489,crossing the Han River.
"00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,739",2.895,This guy clearly has no idea what Gyeonggi-do even looks like.
"00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,682",1.861,"I went all the way up there, but…"
"00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:49,799",1.034,"Jeez, I'm tearing up."
"00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,866",1.985,"Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?"
"00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,562",1.613,A slap in his face won't cut it.
"00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,712",2.067,I should just put three bullets in him.
"00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:01,337",3.143,Do you know what it's like for me to go to Seoul on the weekend too?
"00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,736",2.317,How could they set me up with someone like that?
"00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,051",2.233,"Being divorced, I don't care about."
"00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,623",1.489,It's no big deal these days.
"00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:11,262",3.556,I would even be jealous. I might even be okay if he's been married twice.
"00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:14,157",2.812,"But come on, he has a kid!"
"00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,078",3.142,Nothing's more precious to you than your own kid.
"00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,345",3.184,But that kid means nothing to me since it's not my kid.
"00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:25,033",2.109,We already have such a huge thing dividing us.
"00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,639",2.523,"A woman and a man are trying to live together,"
"00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,574",2.853,"but if their priorities are different, how could that ever work?"
"00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,240",0.868,Hey.
"00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,590",2.853,His kid is an eighth-grader. You know what they're like.
"00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:43,850",4.177,You can't tell if they are animals or a malfunctioning cyborg…
"00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,511",3.473,A lot of people who already have kids marry each other and live happily.
"00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,696",2.316,They recognize the importance of each other's kids
"00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:00,929",1.322,and care for them…
"00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,329",1.406,Why should I not say anything?
"00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:30,870",1.282,Did you two fight?
"00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,025",2.026,How could you be like this on her birthday?
"00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,510",1.489,Did your mom give you anything?
"00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:50,845",0.827,"Come on, eat up."
"00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,146",2.936,Look at me. Do I look like I haven't eaten yet?
"00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,977",1.406,What did your mom give you?
"00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,169",1.406,Didn't she give you anything?
"00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,203",0.951,She did.
"00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,725",2.440,Then why aren't you telling me what she gave you?
"00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,324",1.448,I asked her for money.
"00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:20,580",0.828,Happy birthday.
"00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:23,474",2.316,They're earphones. Expensive ones.
"00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,328",0.827,Thank you.
"00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:28,850",1.447,Thanks for being born.
"00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:31,662",0.951,"Thank you, truly."
"00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,832",2.233,Who do your Auntie Hui-seon and I have but you?
"00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,305",2.894,"When we're old and lonely, I'm glad we'll have someone to call."
"00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:42,208",1.406,"Hey, don't worry."
"00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:46,964",4.260,I won't bother you too much. I'll try to kick the bucket in one go.
"00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,520",1.861,-I got it. -I'm just relieved.
"00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,490",2.604,I'm glad to have you. You're like insurance.
"00:09:56,104 --> 00:10:00,529",4.425,"When you were born, you were so little. I couldn't believe you were actually real."
"00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:03,836",3.225,When did you get this big? When did you turn into a whole person?
"00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:08,635",3.433,"By the way, do you usually speak this quietly in a barbecue restaurant?"
"00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:15,333",3.225,I've never seen people whispering while drinking at a barbecue place.
"00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,048",2.398,"-I feel terrible, I drank too much. -Right."
"00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,867",1.736,"Hey, it's late, let's go."
"00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,150",1.199,"Yes, it's late."
"00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,809",0.827,Go.
"00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:01,113",1.157,I'm sorry.
"00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,174",1.324,"Pick it up for her, will you?"
"00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,911",1.241,"A beer, please!"
"00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,392",1.034,Where is he?
"00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,167",1.489,Thank you.
"00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,276",2.026,I may have gotten divorced…
"00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,032",1.985,but the best decision I ever made
"00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,810",0.951,was getting married.
"00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:30,559",3.102,How else would I have met such a precious kid?
"00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:49,582",1.117,How do you know him?
"00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,105",0.869,From work.
"00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,379",2.192,Then you should've said hi sooner.
"00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,563",2.564,I just know his face. We're not on the same team.
"00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,312",1.530,Jo Yu-rim!
"00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,166",2.027,Did you eat the seaweed soup I made for you this morning?
"00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:20,143",2.895,You call that soup? It was so thick that I couldn't get the ladle in.
"00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,237",1.654,What did Auntie Gyeong-seon get you?
"00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,745",2.439,That looks expensive.
"00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,895",2.067,<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
"00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,843",2.233,We're already here. Hurry up.
"00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,076",2.150,<i>I'm on my way. I'll be there soon!</i>
"00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,750",1.737,I can't believe him.
"00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,092",1.364,YEOM GI-JEONG
"00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,814",3.143,So you were messaging me and that guy at the same time?
"00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,386",1.489,"At one in the morning, at that!"
"00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:57,901",3.433,You don't do that? Everyone texts more than two people all the time.
"00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,589",2.606,Not when I'm texting my lover at one in the morning.
"00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,897",3.226,"I don't text my lover ""I miss you too"" when it's meant for someone else"
"00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,262",1.282,and then delete it.
"00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:10,183",4.839,I don't send a bunch of heart emojis and LOLs to others while texting my lover.
"00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:13,450",2.688,Did I meet him in person and flirt or something?
"00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,138",2.605,You know you have to be more friendly in messages.
"00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,653",3.432,You can't tell if words are being said with a smile or a serious look.
"00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:22,755",3.019,That's why I stick a LOL at the end of everything.
"00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:23,913",1.075,Don't you do that?
"00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,883",3.184,"Is that why you told him you missed him, then?"
"00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:29,330",1.364,To be friendly?
"00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:31,109",1.695,What's wrong with saying I miss him?
"00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:35,244",4.053,I miss BTS. I miss my grandma. I miss my uncle.
"00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,609",1.282,I miss a lot of people.
"00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:40,206",3.514,Don't you miss anyone? Don't you ever tell people you miss them?
"00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,564",2.274,"Don't you know ""I miss you"" means ""I love you""?"
"00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,087",1.488,Only to you.
"00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,617",1.448,It only means that to you!
"00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,230",1.530,Try asking people!
"00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,835",2.523,If a man and a woman say they miss each other at night
"00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,324",1.406,means anything or not.
"00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,391",1.530,"I told you to wait, please!"
"00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,963",1.488,"Sure, fine, let's ask."
"00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,039",0.993,Who should we ask?
"00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:58,858",1.737,"-Go on, ask someone! -Seriously."
"00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:03,407",3.061,"You're worried about the cab fare even in this situation, aren't you?"
"00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,427",2.937,You asked to meet here because of that too.
"00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,700",2.191,-Yes. -Do you want to end things like that?
"00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,272",1.489,"Yes, absolutely."
"00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:12,670",2.315,What's wrong with meeting in the middle for once?
"00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:16,268",3.514,I went to your neighborhood to see you every time.
"00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:18,171",1.819,Do you know how far it is from my home?
"00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:21,438",3.184,I had to spend another hour and a half just to get home.
"00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,416",2.895,That's your problem. Who told you to live so far away?
"00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,735",2.192,Then does he live in Seoul?
"00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:35,913",1.366,Let me ask you one thing.
"00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:40,007",2.482,Does he even know that you have a lover?
"00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,135",2.771,-He knows I have a boyfriend. -Is a boyfriend not a lover?
"00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:51,131",4.632,"Who uses the word ""lover"" these days? It's so lame."
"00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,736",2.522,Even people born in the 70s don't say that.
"00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,011",2.192,Ask around if people still use that word.
"00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:57,789",1.033,You know what?
"00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,766",1.943,You are unbearably old-fashioned. Really.
"00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,157",1.488,Disgustingly old-fashioned!
"00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,844",1.282,We're home.
"00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:09,794",0.868,We're home.
"00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,003",0.952,Keep it down!
"00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,646",0.827,Hey.
"00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,334",2.151,"That guy was telling us off earlier, wasn't he?"
"00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,395",1.655,It was our mistake.
"00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,917",1.240,How were we to know?
"00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,526",2.357,Apologize and give him a gift certificate for me.
"00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,346",1.736,I'll give it to you later.
"00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:13,895",1.158,That's too much.
"00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:17,872",1.943,-Where are you going? -To get my hair done.
"00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,767",2.813,You say you're tired every morning but you're going out again?
"00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,579",2.729,-You should rest on the weekend. -As if anyone would let me.
"00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,252",2.316,I'll die if I work in the field on a day like today.
"00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,745",1.943,Go and pretend you're helping at least.
"00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,219",2.688,Don't just sit around all day until your dad tears into you.
"00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,520",2.647,Don't you feel bad that your old man has been out
"00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,670",2.067,working under the sun all day?
"00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,054",1.612,I was going to go help him.
"00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,184",2.068,"Hey, Dad."
"00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:19,793",1.489,I have something to tell you.
"00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,226",1.861,Just eat your food quietly.
"00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:36,997",0.951,I mean…
"00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:40,305",1.778,I'm not asking for help or anything.
"00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,490",3.102,"I just want your permission. An ""okay"" or something like that."
"00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:47,915",0.910,I'm…
"00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:50,851",1.613,thinking of buying a car.
"00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,603",2.274,It's an electric car.
"00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:05,573",3.886,"Electric cars don't cost that much. It's only 7,000 won to fully charge it."
"00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,600",1.943,"They say 50,000 won is enough per month."
"00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,088",1.406,"If it's 50,000 won a month,"
"00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,694",2.522,that's a lot cheaper than taking the bus or the train.
"00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,134",2.358,And second-hand cars don't even cost that much.
"00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,145",2.191,Don't you remember the last time you bought a car
"00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:19,634",1.406,and put yourself through hell?
"00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,495",1.282,"Back then, I--"
"00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,555",2.977,"You couldn't even afford it, but you bought it on an installment plan."
"00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:26,747",2.109,So I had no choice but to help you.
"00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,070",1.240,But you're at it again?
"00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:31,173",3.020,What I'm saying is I didn't know any better then.
"00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,661",1.406,I do now.
"00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:36,135",3.392,"My expenses, budget, my spending habits… I know all that stuff now."
"00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:39,071",2.853,So I'm planning to get a small electric car.
"00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,628",2.399,Don't just say no without considering it.
"00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,868",1.158,Just hear me out.
"00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:47,011",2.522,"It's a car, it's not like it's some luxury item."
"00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:50,155",3.061,And I'm not buying it so I can show off to anyone.
"00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,883",2.646,"I mean, how can I? They don't even go fast."
"00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,868",0.909,Look.
"00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,087",4.135,"If Mi-jeong, Gi-jeong, and I stay out late and take a taxi home, that's 30,000 won."
"00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,072",1.902,"With an electric car, it'll cost 3,000 won,"
"00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,850",1.695,"but we're paying 30,000 won for it."
"00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,012",1.778,"Dad, come on, I mean…"
"00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,328",2.233,I'm not being unreasonable here.
"00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:12,941",1.530,"If you think about it, I'm right."
"00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:14,802",1.779,An electric car is cheaper.
"00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,490",2.606,"Don't just say no because it's a car, please."
"00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,392",0.868,How much is it?
"00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,238",2.067,"Like I said, it's a cheap one."
"00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:25,678",1.075,In installments again?
"00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,494",0.909,Dad.
"00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,976",0.992,I…
"00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,830",1.324,don't have a car
"00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,021",1.199,and I live in Gyeonggi-do.
"00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:58,349",3.061,How am I supposed to get married let alone date anyone?
"00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:02,815",3.928,"All of the magic happens inside a car, but I don't have one, Dad!"
"00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,387",1.489,Where can I kiss a girl?
"00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:17,041",1.819,Why are you being like this again?
"00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,192",1.241,Seriously…
"00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:22,873",2.399,"I don't want to keep any secrets from you, Dad."
"00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,470",2.688,I really don't want to hide anything at all from you.
"00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:30,151",3.060,"Honestly, I could buy a car secretly, hide it anywhere I wanted"
"00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,888",1.654,and act like I never bought one.
"00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,162",2.191,"But I don't want to do that, okay?"
"00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,726",2.480,I don't want to hide anything at all from you.
"00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:38,256",1.447,I never have.
"00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:40,696",0.992,I wish you would.
"00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:44,749",2.853,Please hide it from me.
"00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:49,671",1.200,Come on.
"00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,292",1.530,"That punk, I ought to…"
"00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,021",2.646,I told him to keep his mouth shut at the dinner table.
"00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,014",0.910,Goodness.
"00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:21,762",2.439,"Tell him your dad will start at seven tomorrow,"
"00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,954",1.613,but he can come by nine.
"00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:25,897",1.861,Don't just tell him to come by nine.
"00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,875",2.894,Then he'll know what you mean and come early.
"00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:34,086",3.598,Why do we have to walk on eggshells around someone we hired.
"00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,206",1.488,"That brat, one of these days…"
"00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:47,237",2.482,I ought to just…
"00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:12,464",2.069,They said you can come by nine tomorrow.
"00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:49,063",1.819,{\an8}I'm going to sue that salon.
"00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:04,778",6.327,{\an8}<i>On the street that the nun walks across</i>
"00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:12,552",6.782,{\an8}<i>My old friend pretends He doesn't even know me</i>
"00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,827",2.191,{\an8}-<i>Like how they sell cigarettes</i> -Don't wash your hair.
"00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,191",1.282,{\an8}Your curls will come undone.
"00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:20,038",3.763,{\an8}-That's why I'm washing it. -<i>At a local pharmacy</i>
"00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:23,512",3.391,{\an8}<i>-The world carries on peacefully</i> -What a waste of money.
"00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,489",2.895,{\an8}<i>It goes its own way</i>
"00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,542",3.143,{\an8}-<i>Bustling down the street</i> -<i>I'm currently working two jobs.</i>
"00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:33,354",2.233,{\an8}I'm a soccer coach at an elementary school
"00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,091",1.654,{\an8}and I also run a coffee shop.
"00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:40,301",2.977,"{\an8}If I'm being honest, it's just one job. The cafe went bankrupt."
"00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:43,445",3.060,{\an8}<i>On that roadside</i>
"00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,471",1.943,{\an8}-<i>Where time breathes -Actually…</i>
"00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:47,415",1.861,{\an8}what I love most is singing.
"00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:50,640",3.142,{\an8}To be able to support myself with my singing is my dream.
"00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:55,065",3.432,{\an8}<i>Without anybody knowing</i>
"00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:59,325",3.639,{\an8}<i>I walked around crying</i>

"00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,183",1.116,So I've never done it.
"00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:50,748",1.406,How did you go to the bathroom?
"00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,560",1.283,A bike lock.
"00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:56,992",2.853,I just wrapped one around the handles and went.
"00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:02,947",2.895,Be sure to let me know when you get married.
"00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,271",1.241,I'll give you
"00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,620",2.771,five hundred thousand won to congratulate you.
"00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:12,376",1.488,"I'm serious, let me know."
"00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:14,279",0.951,I mean it!
"00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:15,809",0.951,I will.
"00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:19,489",2.440,"Just because I'm closing the store down,"
"00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:22,012",2.440,it doesn't mean I'm closing the door on our friendship.
"00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:27,429",1.034,What do you think?
"00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:29,911",1.448,Will you get married next year?
"00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:36,735",1.242,What is it?
"00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:49,182",2.605,What decides your fate? She says it's your outlook on life.
"00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:50,630",1.365,Then what's my outlook?
"00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:54,724",3.598,I can be positive about things occasionally.
"00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:56,130",1.324,"Just one day, on my payday."
"00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,156",1.944,I'm not so bad that day.
"00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,837",2.647,You can afford to have a good outlook if you have money.
"00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,897",2.977,The saying that love makes you kind has some truth to it.

"00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:17,966",3.309,So how am I supposed to be positive and have a good outlook on things?

"00:48:23,342 --> 00:48:24,954",1.612,but it just made me feel worse.
"00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,913",3.060,I can't drink anymore. I feel so terrible.
"00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:40,173",3.060,I feel even more terrible because I don't like how I look today.
"00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:41,992",1.736,I just want to go home and lie down.
"00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:15,193",1.920,"If you're more than five days late on your credit loan payment,"
"00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,840",2.564,your card gets suspended and things become complicated.
"00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,603",2.853,This is why you shouldn't take out loans to lend others money.
"00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:27,558",1.985,Do you know how much your loan balance is?
"00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:36,863",2.316,"For 15,484 million won,"

"00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:34,885",1.696,I'm home.
"00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,331",1.364,"Hey, what about dinner?"
"00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:37,779",1.364,I ate.
"00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,343",2.481,"Close the door properly, or mosquitoes will come in."
"00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,728",2.606,What's the occasion? You never come here on the weekend.
"00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:09,085",1.820,I guess you don't have anything better to do.
"00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,454",2.936,Hey. What about us?
"00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,369",1.489,Gwang-min's driving me crazy.
"00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:46,181",2.027,I'm seriously considering quitting teaching.
"00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,206",1.943,How could a teacher badmouth his students?
"00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,572",1.282,You're an adult.
"00:52:49,654 --> 00:52:51,805",2.151,You badmouth your colleagues every day too.
"00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:52,880",0.993,They're my colleagues.
"00:52:53,831 --> 00:52:56,396",2.565,"My colleagues are kids, okay?"
"00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:59,539",3.061,Who's that woman? The one you're always badmouthing.
"00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:03,839",4.218,"The one who has ""nasty, nasty, nasty,"" written all over her face."
"00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:06,321",2.399,"Gwang-min is that woman to me, all right?"
"00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:10,373",3.970,Do you know how hard it is to be stuck in a classroom with Gwang-min all day long?
"00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:11,573",1.117,Do you play favorites?
"00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,434",1.779,"Yes, totally."
"00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:15,915",1.903,What about you? Don't you play favorites?
"00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,982",1.985,I never play favorites. I hate everyone.
"00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:20,630",1.614,There isn't a single person I like.
"00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,152",1.613,You can't keep being like that.
"00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,254",3.020,"I mean, that's why you struggle every day and keep getting older."
"00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:28,900",1.033,Jeez.
"00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,795",1.695,I guarantee you.
"00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:35,270",3.392,Gwang-min isn't the problem. You're the problem.
"00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:38,371",2.440,I also have a guarantee of my own.
"00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:42,631",4.178,"Your colleague who has ""nasty, nasty, nasty,"" written all over her face"
"00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,235",1.985,"is probably normal too, you know?"
"00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:46,725",1.406,She's only like that to you.
"00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:48,999",0.992,"Let's stop,"
"00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:50,984",1.902,-or we'll develop feelings. -For who?
"00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,759",1.737,"Hey, give me another can."
"00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,447",1.323,Stop bringing it over.
"00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,019",0.951,We've had enough.
"00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,497",3.307,Stop that. Is it that funny that I broke up with her?
"00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,799",3.350,"Just because I'm single, doesn't mean I'm going to hang out with you."
"00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:53,100",4.219,"To be honest, we only became friends because we lived in the countryside."
"00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:57,194",4.012,"If we lived in the city, I wouldn't have been friends with you."
"00:54:57,897 --> 00:55:01,164",3.267,"There were less than 15 people our age within a 10km radius,"
"00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:03,810",2.564,so I had no choice but to hang out with you.
"00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:06,540",2.647,That's the problem with the countryside. Everyone ends up being friends.
"00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:09,848",3.226,When I tell people that the four of us used to play together.
"00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,833",1.902,{\an8}They think we got along really well.
"00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,976",2.522,"{\an8}But the truth is, there were only four kids around here."
"00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:19,484",3.267,"{\an8}She had no one her age and played with the village idiot, didn't she?"
"00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,394",0.827,{\an8}With Dumbo.
"00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:24,033",3.102,{\an8}Don't call him Dumbo. He's over forty now.
"00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:26,267",2.151,{\an8}Forty? Probably more like fifty.
"00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,601",3.681,"{\an8}In the countryside, friends and family are the same."
"00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:35,034",3.351,"{\an8}Do you get to choose your family? You're born, and they're your family."
"00:55:35,116 --> 00:55:37,722",2.606,{\an8}And they say this kid living next door is your friend.
"00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:41,030",2.481,"{\an8}Even at school, if you don't like the kid next to you,"
"00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:43,842",2.729,{\an8}you can just play with another kid. But in this neighborhood?
"00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,951",2.026,{\an8}You don't get to choose. It drives me nuts.
"00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:50,707",4.673,"{\an8}Hey, I feel the same. I never became friends with you because I liked you too."
"00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:56,993",1.985,{\an8}I should have been born in the Joseon era.
"00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,948",2.522,"{\an8}""From this day forth, this person is your spouse."""
"00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:05,802",2.771,"{\an8}Then I'd say, ""Yes, I promise to love him with all my heart."""
"00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:07,249",1.365,"{\an8}Even if I lived like that,"
"00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:09,441",1.654,{\an8}I think I would have been just fine.
"00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:14,321",3.225,{\an8}This era where you have to choose someone for yourself is way harder for me.
"00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:20,359",2.647,{\an8}I get rejected every day but I prefer being in the present.
"00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:23,254",2.812,"{\an8}If I were born in Joseon, I'd definitely have been a peasant."
"00:56:24,536 --> 00:56:26,148",1.612,{\an8}You're a peasant right now as well.
"00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,984",1.944,"They say that if the crickets are chirping,"
"00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:38,183",1.117,it's 24 degrees Celcius out.
"00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:41,036",1.654,"Apparently, they know"
"00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,434",2.315,that winter's on its way.
"00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,612",3.143,That's why they're working so hard to find a mate
"00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:49,762",2.068,so they don't have to spend the winter alone.
"00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,668",3.225,"Even those tiny little creatures find love, you know?"
"00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:57,703",0.951,"But as humans,"
"00:56:57,785 --> 00:56:59,812",2.027,shouldn't we be able to find love too?
"00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:03,534",3.640,Even they know what it's like to have no partner in winter.
"00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,684",2.068,"They're chirping away so desperately,"
"00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:09,323",3.556,"crying ""winter's coming, it'll be cold, don't leave me all alone."""
"00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:11,225",1.033,We should do that too.
"00:57:12,218 --> 00:57:13,046",0.828,Okay?
"00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,278",1.613,What are you going on about?
"00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,496",3.059,Do humans have to do it just because bugs and even cats do it?
"00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:23,053",2.936,Do we have to poop on the street like dogs do?
"00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:26,444",3.309,"Don't then, you bastard! I'll kill you if you do, okay?"
"00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:29,380",0.909,"Hey, let's do it."
"00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,565",1.696,"Let's do it, okay?"
"00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:37,899",2.894,I'm going to do it. I'm going to love just anyone.
"00:57:39,884 --> 00:57:41,001",1.117,Anyone? Really?
"00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:42,656",1.572,"Yes, anyone."
"00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:44,475",1.737,Why can't I just love anyone?
"00:57:44,557 --> 00:57:46,956",2.399,I was picky and ended up like this.
"00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,058",3.019,"I was so careful not to pick a loser, I have no one."
"00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,821",2.853,I'm allowed to just love anyone. I'm going to love just anyone.
"00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:57,460",1.116,"Starting tomorrow,"
"00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,521",1.489,why don't you two just disappear?
"00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:02,796",0.869,They're nuts.
"00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:12,679",1.323,-Thank you for the meal. -Yes.
"00:58:12,762 --> 00:58:14,292",1.530,You worked hard. Go rest.
"00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,739",1.364,"Yes, get some rest."

"00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,916",1.488,And don't drink too much!

"00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:54,696",0.952,You're nuts.
"00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:55,937",1.158,Why would you do that?
"00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:49,699",2.730,I was wondering if you could receive a piece of mail for me.
