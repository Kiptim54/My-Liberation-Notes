"00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:29,318",3.545,I know she doesn't care about you. Why does she have to pretend she does?
"00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,824",2.210,She must be doing this to get money from you.

"00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:49,625",4.213,To think that someone I saw in the afternoon passed in the evening…
"00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,300",2.919,She must have wanted to meet her son-in-law before she left.

"00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,443",2.127,Maybe because I didn't see it coming at all.
"00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,864",2.669,It's natural that you come and you go.
"00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:49,411",4.254,But I wish everyone could leave at the right time.

"00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,299",2.962,It would have been shameless if she was looking for a guy to date
"00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,175",1.793,after her mother passed away.
"00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,680",4.421,But it's as if she knew something like this was going to happen.
"00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,307",1.544,It was as if she was possessed.
"00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,808",1.418,Can you believe her?
"00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:39,271",4.380,Pretending to have lost her memories after getting rejected.
"00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:43,775",3.753,She was so desperate. She grabbed onto him in such a hurry.
"00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,405",2.669,And then her mom passed away.
"00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,577",2.086,"So now,"
"00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,999",5.339,she would be blameless if she decided to move out.
"00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,626",1.459,I can feel it.
"00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,963",1.835,Gi-jeong will move out soon.
"00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:09,634",3.503,"Seeing that her boyfriend has visited for three days in a row,"
"00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:12,387",0.959,I can tell.
"00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,430",0.959,Yes.
"00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:14,890",1.377,Right.
"00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,850",1.877,And Chang-hee also quit his job
"00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:20,020",3.087,"-at the perfect time, right? -Yes."
"00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:31,907",1.293,Seriously…
"00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:35,869",3.128,Isn't my sixth sense amazing?
"00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,334",3.295,That must have been why I wanted to quit so badly.
"00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:47,631",4.630,"But in retrospect, I didn't want to quit that badly."
"00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:51,468",2.836,It just felt like the right time to quit.
"00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:56,473",2.419,I guess my soul just knew.
"00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:01,686",1.584,"If I weren't unemployed,"
"00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:04,773",1.627,who would take care of my dad?
"00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:12,656",4.004,"After the three of us go to work, and without Gu, he'd be all by himself."
"00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,080",2.002,The thought makes me tear up.
"00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,547",1.919,"I was like this when I was younger, too."
"00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,967",2.378,"When I was in high school, my homeroom teacher said"
"00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,928",2.878,we'd be in trouble if anyone skipped the after-school classes.
"00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,806",2.795,"I had never skipped them before,"
"00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,684",2.795,but I really wanted to go home that day for some reason.
"00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,896",3.587,It wasn't like I had anything to do at home. I just wanted to go home.
"00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,273",1.293,So I did.
"00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,483",1.460,My grandma was alone at home.
"00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:51,570",1.585,"When I said, ""I'm home,"""
"00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,281",2.628,"her eyes were open, but she wouldn't answer me."
"00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,533",1.710,Something felt off.
"00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:00,871",3.337,I felt like I had to hold her hand so I did.
"00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,747",1.167,"But soon,"
"00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,792",1.626,"I got the chills,"
"00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,254",1.627,"and thought, ""She must be gone."""
"00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,134",2.294,"I suddenly got scared, so I pulled my hand away."
"00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:16,803",1.710,"Then I thought, ""This isn't right."""
"00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:20,515",2.919,So I held her hand tight again.
"00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,602",3.003,"About five minutes later,"
"00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:25,645",1.960,my dad came back.
"00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,898",2.169,"""Where did you go, leaving Grandma alone?"""
"00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:32,319",3.796,It was the first time in my life telling Dad off like that.
"00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:36,823",3.420,He couldn't say a thing and just listened to me.
"00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:39,868",1.460,And it kind of felt
"00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:41,953",1.126,cathartic.
"00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,084",1.960,"If I hadn't skipped school that day,"
"00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:50,962",2.085,my grandma would've passed away all alone.
"00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,884",3.754,"Just like this, my soul knows and my body just follows."
"00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:11,691",0.959,I never thought…
"00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:18,114",3.211,I would be waiting for Gi-jeong to come home.
"00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,955",3.129,"After spending the whole day with my dad alone,"
"00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,416",1.876,when Gi-jeong and Mi-jeong come home…
"00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,212",1.085,it feels
"00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,090",1.085,less lonely.
"00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,651",1.418,"When you feel lonely,"
"00:27:54,734 --> 00:28:00,156",5.422,I hope you remember that Oh Du-hwan is also feeling lonely somewhere.
"00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,868",2.628,And this song is for us.
"00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,916",2.878,<i>I didn't say</i>
"00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:15,380",4.379,<i>Or do anything</i>
"00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:22,304",6.215,<i>Just your name alone Makes my heart ache</i>
"00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:29,144",5.923,<i>Why didn't I know That you'd be leaving so far away</i>
"00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:34,900",5.673,<i>My love I guess this is our goodbye</i>
"00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:42,949",6.798,<i>The times I've sulked at you Without good reason</i>
"00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:50,040",5.965,<i>And the times I've been Too harsh and negligent</i>
"00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:56,755",6.090,<i>I never got to tell you How sorry I am</i>
"00:28:56,838 --> 00:29:03,094",6.256,<i>My love I guess this is our goodbye</i>
"00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:11,186",6.590,<i>No matter how many times I tell myself</i>
"00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:16,441",4.546,<i>That it'd be okay And that you'd understand</i>
"00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:25,408",7.007,<i>The memories that I cannot forget</i>
"00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:31,706",6.214,-<i>Come a step too late as regret</i> -It's cold. Let's go.
"00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:38,672",6.882,<i>If only for a day I could see you again</i>
"00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:45,595",5.839,<i>I would cry for hours on end In your presence</i>
"00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:52,686",6.215,<i>Even the wind sounds So quiet in the sky today</i>
"00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:59,484",6.715,<i>My love I guess this is our goodbye</i>
"00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,406",2.086,It still bothers me that Mr. Gu didn't come.
"00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:08,201",2.336,Don't you have any way of contacting him?
"00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,370",2.086,They don't even know his name.
"00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:14,416",2.503,How could she not know the name of the person she dated?
"00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,380",1.210,Good night.
"00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:21,506",1.043,Good night.
"00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,590",1.001,Bye.
"00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:23,717",1.043,Good night.

"00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:41,260",1.084,One moment.

"00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:28,617",1.001,How would we know?

"00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,372",1.293,No wonder.
"00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,583",3.128,People kept whispering about Mi-jeong at the funeral.
"00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,918",1.251,Really?
"00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,839",2.878,They said she was dating him to get a permanent position.
"00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:43,716",1.794,Can't you sue him for that?
"00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:58,522",3.086,<i>Are you busy? Can I stop by?</i>

"00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,987",2.711,<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>
"00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,892",2.920,"My asshole team leader is having an affair with some employee,"
"00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:19,895",2.377,and he saved her number under my name.
"00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,188",1.210,No way.
"00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,025",2.252,"Since everyone knows he hates me,"
"00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,362",3.253,he must've thought it'd be safe if he saved it under my name.
"00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,864",1.918,I knew he was having an affair.
"00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:33,158",1.334,And with whom.
"00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:35,494",0.959,Who is it?
"00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:42,459",5.005,"A while back, I called the two of them since they were late for a meeting."
"00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,755",3.754,And it was eerily identical how both calls were so silent.
"00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:50,801",2.836,"There wasn't any background noise, as if they were in a vacuum."
"00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:53,053",1.501,For the two of them.
"00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,347",1.501,They were in a motel.
"00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,933",1.877,It became so obvious after that.
"00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:01,770",2.627,"When I saw a shampoo in her bag,"
"00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,857",2.419,I wondered why she would carry shampoo around.
"00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,694",2.920,It was to avoid smelling the same by using different shampoos.
"00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:16,034",2.877,When that asshole would start ranting at me…
"00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:16,952",0.834,<i>Is it that hard?</i>

"00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,212",4.212,"{\an8}<i>align a stack of papers with a ""tap""</i>"

"00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:31,758",2.085,{\an8}-Seriously… -<i>Then he would</i>

"00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,598",2.086,{\an8}<i>She was signaling him to stop.</i>
"00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,310",2.086,"{\an8}Since then, whenever he started ranting,"
"00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,562",1.543,"{\an8}I'd end up looking at her hands,"
"00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,440",2.252,{\an8}<i>wondering when she'd give the signal.</i>
"00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:51,028",3.420,"{\an8}<i>At first, I was grateful for her fingertips</i>"
"00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:53,447",1.293,{\an8}fluttering like a butterfly.
"00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:55,782",1.167,"{\an8}But now,"

"00:57:37,823 --> 00:57:40,159",2.336,Is she doing all right?
"00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:44,538",3.211,You should ask her yourself. Aren't you closer to her than me?
"00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:52,880",1.084,Chang-hee.
"00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:55,508",1.210,<i>I…</i>
"00:57:58,552 --> 00:58:00,596",2.044,need people who are happy.
"00:58:04,683 --> 00:58:05,935",1.252,"<i>So, Chang-hee…</i>"
"00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:10,731",1.960,you have to be happy.
"00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,155",2.085,I carry on thanks to you.
"00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:55,484",0.959,Dad.
"00:58:57,319 --> 00:58:58,445",1.126,Don't worry.
"00:58:58,529 --> 00:58:59,655",1.126,We'll…
"00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:01,949",1.335,be even happier.
"00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:08,956",0.918,But…
"00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,418",2.002,for a family of four to be happy…
"00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:16,005",1.418,we need a car.
"00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:39,153",2.962,I think it's my first time coming to the beach with Dad.
"00:59:39,236 --> 00:59:41,947",2.711,It's the first time we've come to the beach as a family.
"00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:43,866",1.835,"When it was just you and me,"
"00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:46,243",2.294,I have memories of going places with Mom and Dad.
"00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:48,954",2.627,But nothing after Mi-jeong was born.
"00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:55,377",4.671,It's because it was hard for all five of us to go around on buses and trains.
"00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:58,547",2.294,That's not the reason.
"00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:02,676",4.045,"It's because Auntie got into trouble then. And ever since then, nothing."
"01:00:04,136 --> 01:00:07,306",3.170,The villain of our family is Auntie.
"01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,185",2.378,That sounds scary. I'm going to be an aunt one day.
"01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:16,565",4.504,"Hey, it's not possible for us to become an aunt who robs her family."
"01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:18,442",1.793,"Dad loved her, you know?"
"01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:21,153",2.628,That's why he cared for her and sold off his own land.
"01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:23,822",2.168,But this asshole doesn't love us that much.
"01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:25,324",1.418,You have no idea.
"01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:28,035",2.127,I would give you everything if I had anything.
"01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:29,453",1.335,I just can't because I don't.
"01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:33,082",3.546,"Hey. Once we get married, let's not bother each other over money."
"01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:35,334",2.169,Yes. Let's not ever do that.
"01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:36,961",0.876,Never mind.
"01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,796",1.293,Bother me.
"01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,341",2.294,"On second thought, I think I'd give you money, too."
"01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,927",1.377,But you need to know this.
"01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:47,471",2.002,We can do that because we love each other.
"01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:50,015",2.461,But do you think our children will love us that much?
"01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,267",2.168,"I don't think so, you know? That's the problem."
"01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:57,231",4.338,"Dad loved Aunt, but we didn't. That's the problem."
"01:00:57,314 --> 01:01:01,694",4.380,That's why they say you can get away with anything if you have love.
"01:01:33,392 --> 01:01:34,810",1.418,You still have
"01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:38,188",2.794,"the three of us by your side, Dad."
"01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:43,902",1.167,Dad…
"01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:48,449",1.418,I love you.
"01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:35,412",4.046,I thought I was taking care of them all this time.
"01:02:37,122 --> 01:02:39,625",2.503,I only realized after she passed away…
"01:02:41,502 --> 01:02:44,129",2.627,that Hye-suk and the kids
"01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:47,800",3.003,were the ones taking care of me.
"01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,947",2.920,YEOM MI-JEONG
"01:03:20,874 --> 01:03:21,959",1.085,You're…
"01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:24,753",1.626,"doing well, right?"
"01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:29,675",1.168,"Yes, sir."
"01:03:53,198 --> 01:03:55,701",2.503,YEOM MI-JEONG
"01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:22,853",1.877,I'm not sad at all.
"01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:29,026",1.835,But why do I keep tearing up?
"01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:40,347",0.834,<i>Hello?</i>
"01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:45,769",1.001,<i>Hello?</i>
"01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,646",1.126,It's been a while.
"01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:52,067",1.043,It's Gu.
"01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,573",1.334,<i>It has been a while.</i>
"01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:02,119",1.377,How have you been?
"01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:06,415",1.752,Have you managed to liberate yourself?
"01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,126",1.126,<i>Of course not.</i>
"01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,717",2.128,Have you met someone who worships you?
"01:06:19,803 --> 01:06:20,846",1.043,<i>Of course not.</i>
"01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:25,809",1.001,Let's meet up.
"01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:29,146",1.210,<i>I can't.</i>
"01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:31,815",0.876,Why?
"01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:37,279",1.251,<i>I've gained weight.</i>
"01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,448",1.418,<i>I need to lose some weight.</i>
"01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:45,370",2.002,Lose some weight in an hour and meet me.
"01:07:51,144 --> 01:07:52,771",1.627,You haven't gained much.
"01:08:05,826 --> 01:08:06,660",0.834,What?
"01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:12,541",2.378,You've grown your hair.
"01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,589",1.418,Aren't I handsome?
"01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,054",1.335,And you've cut your hair.
"01:08:27,097 --> 01:08:28,306",1.209,"Yes, a little."
"01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:32,727",1.251,You changed your number.
"01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,105",1.126,That was a bold move.
"01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,613",2.043,I was so angry waiting for you to call.
"01:08:45,824 --> 01:08:48,118",2.294,It's not like you don't know where I live.
"01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,620",2.419,I thought you'd be able to if you really wanted to.
"01:08:52,873 --> 01:08:55,459",2.586,You never called my previous number.
"01:08:56,668 --> 01:08:57,544",0.876,Did you?
"01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:05,385",2.210,I missed you. So much.
"01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:10,891",1.794,It sounds real now that I've said it.
"01:09:12,976 --> 01:09:14,936",1.960,It feels like I really missed you so much.
"01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:24,196",3.421,I wanted to squeeze you and swallow you down in one mouthful.
"01:09:30,243 --> 01:09:32,037",1.794,Aren't I good at worshiping now?
"01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,633",1.585,What is your name?
"01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:49,054",2.836,It's Gu Ja-gyeong.
