"00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,065",2.481,But he shouldn't say that to another woman.

"00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:13,799",3.888,That's not all he said. He says I should move there.
"00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,776",2.895,Do you ask just anyone to move to your neighborhood?
"00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,799",2.399,"You fell for him already, didn't you?"
"00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,415",2.646,It's because he told me to move to his neighborhood.
"00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:34,311",2.193,I had no interest in him at all before that.
"00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,348",4.259,"Jerks who lead girls on for fun like him,"

"00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,215",2.357,and that youth ends at the age of 29.
"00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:10,979",3.681,Some people consider his remarks to be more anachronistic than others do.
"00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,535",2.647,"I, for one, believe I'm still young"
"00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,975",2.357,so I think it's absolutely preposterous.
"00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,780",1.779,I was just joking. Now.
"00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:25,246",3.888,We're all here today to figure out

"00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,845",1.819,Did she think they'd last longer?
"00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:03,913",1.117,"Anyway, it's good."
"00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:07,180",3.184,"Now that he's dated every woman here, there isn't anyone left for him to date."
"00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,503",1.240,He'll be quiet for a while.
"00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,906",4.507,What age range would you consider to be youth?
"00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:22,316",4.135,Rumor has it that he and a new girl in the management are a thing.
"00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,113",1.613,Unbelievable.

"00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,501",2.026,I think we should scrap all of their data.
"00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,782",1.198,"Okay, I'll check."
"00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:38,734",0.868,Okay.
"00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,373",1.861,"You didn't hear anything, okay?"
"00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,371",1.241,Where's Hyeon-a?
"00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:11,983",1.530,She's coming with Mi-jeong.
"00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,785",2.812,"It's been a long time since you came out to Seoul, right?"
"00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,390",1.902,You should've worn gold chains too.

"00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:29,766",1.034,Oh Du-hwan.
"00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,613",1.986,Don't ever meet any girls during the summer.
"00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,349",1.654,You seriously smell.
"00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,616",1.944,Make sure you only see them in winter.
"00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,008",2.400,How could you be so cruel?
"00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,778",2.688,He lives alone. He wouldn't know unless someone tells him.
"00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,677",1.736,Yes. Have a drink.
"00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,406",1.613,Toss that shirt out. I'm serious.
"00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:58,426",2.937,"Once it starts to stink, it'll never go away. Throw it away."
"00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,072",2.564,"If I see it again, I'll burn it. I swear."
"00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,745",2.854,You've kept that for years because it's designer.
"00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,689",1.861,No one would consider this designer.
"00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,479",2.854,<i>A politician's comment regarding the age of young people</i>
"00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,050",1.489,<i>has sparked controversy.</i>
"00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,069",2.936,"<i>Currently, each local government defines it differently.</i>"
"00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,881",2.729,"<i>In Seoul, it is considered that youth ends at the age of 29,</i>"
"00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:22,825",1.861,"<i>but in Jeolla-do, it's 39,</i>"
"00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,216",3.308,"<i>and in Bonghwa-gun, North Gyeongsang-do, it's 49.</i>"
"00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,814",3.515,<i>We asked the citizens of Seoul what they considered to be the appropriate age</i>
"00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,461",2.564,<i>at which a person should no longer be classified as youth.</i>
"00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,528",1.985,<i>And 56 percent of the respondents</i>
"00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:36,803",2.192,<i>answered that youth should be between the ages of 19 to 29.</i>
"00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:41,062",4.177,-<i>If youth is defined to be…</i> -I just don't get it.
"00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:47,059",2.895,Is he addicted to dating people at work or what?
"00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,127",1.985,Can't he find a girl anywhere else?
"00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,063",2.275,I guess Park Jin-u has found himself a new girl.
"00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:57,398",3.764,I feel like I know him now because you talk so much about him.
"00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,217",1.737,It's not just him.
"00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,285",1.985,It's the girls that I have a harder time understanding.
"00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:03,601",2.233,They all know who he's been with.
"00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:05,793",2.110,He's already dated a bunch of girls at work.
"00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,447",1.571,Why do they still go out with him?
"00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,872",4.343,Why do they want to belittle themselves by becoming another one of his girls?
"00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,195",1.240,I really don't get it.
"00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,718",1.944,You don't have to get it.
"00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,538",1.737,It's you that I don't get.
"00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:22,541",4.134,{\an8}They're fine with having a casual fling. How is it any of your business?
"00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,354",1.241,{\an8}And how is that belittling?
"00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:28,083",2.647,{\an8}Then have the girls I've dated belittled themselves too?
"00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,516",3.350,"{\an8}From my point of view, they're like one of the girls I've dated."
"00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,632",1.033,"{\an8}I mean,"
"00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:35,817",3.102,"{\an8}does everyone need to be like you and only ever love one person,"
"00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,580",3.681,{\an8}or pretend they're the only person they've ever been with?
"00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,102",1.943,{\an8}They live in a different world from yours.
"00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:44,212",2.027,{\an8}So just leave them to enjoy themselves.
"00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:46,817",2.523,{\an8}They're all happy and having a blast.
"00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,512",1.612,{\an8}They don't care what others think.
"00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:50,953",2.357,"{\an8}You can bad-mouth them, but they just don't care."
"00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,942",1.820,{\an8}Why hasn't he ever asked me out?
"00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,251",1.614,{\an8}You've got to be kidding me.
"00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:15,600",2.522,"{\an8}He dates everyone, so why did he skip me?"
"00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,694",2.481,{\an8}I'm sure Jin-u has his own taste in women.
"00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,382",2.067,{\an8}I'm at least in the top ten at work.
"00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,104",2.729,{\an8}Out of how many women? Are there like 20?
"00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,627",2.439,{\an8}He's even dated someone way less attractive than I am.
"00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,488",1.778,{\an8}So why won't he date me?
"00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:31,812",0.827,{\an8}See?
"00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:35,327",3.433,"{\an8}When I hit her with the facts, she just ignores me and keeps going."
"00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,022",1.612,{\an8}You should've become a politician.
"00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:41,365",4.260,"{\an8}Some of them may be prettier than me, but none of them are as charming as me."
"00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,868",2.728,It's true. I think I'm pretty awesome.
"00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,865",3.681,I'm a woman who has a lot of charm.
"00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,350",2.191,"Hey, drink up. Let's just drink."
"00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,411",1.819,Why aren't the girls here yet?
"00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:12,711",1.075,"You know, I…"
"00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:18,542",3.391,I'm embarrassed that you're my older sister.
"00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:26,566",3.350,"I feel you, Gi-jeong. I can see why you're offended."
"00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:27,641",0.993,Yes.
"00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,423",1.944,"This may not be the right time to ask,"
"00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,212",4.962,"but that girl in your office with ""nasty, nasty, nasty"" all over her face,"
"00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:45,796",2.233,"Park Jin-u's dated her too, right?"
"00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,172",1.323,I knew it.
"00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,033",1.778,It's just as expected.
"00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,969",2.854,I bet she has a beautiful face.
"00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:56,879",0.827,Right?
"00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,774",2.813,I am 100 percent sure she's pretty.
"00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,958",2.357,And I think she's not just pretty
"00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,018",1.902,but also pretty charming.
"00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,594",0.951,Hey.
"00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:15,323",2.232,I'm in front of the statue in the square.
"00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,225",1.322,Where are you?
"00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:21,403",0.827,Over here!
"00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,937",1.654,You got off late today.
"00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,425",1.406,So we could go together.
"00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,666",1.158,Let's go.
"00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,320",0.910,Hold on.
"00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:36,869",1.406,That jerk…
"00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,350",1.075,Who is it?
"00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,569",2.192,Nobody. Let's go. Who's there?
"00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:50,847",1.240,"-Hey, they're here. -Right."
"00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,998",2.068,"-Hey! -Hey, guys."
"00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:54,238",1.157,Hey.
"00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,272",0.951,You're so late.
"00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,389",1.033,What took you so long?
"00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,423",0.951,Sorry.
"00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,656",2.151,Someone here has been a serious buzzkill.
"00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,724",1.985,-Why? -You should've come sooner.
"00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:05,569",3.763,<i>-Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday to you</i>
"00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:09,499",3.846,<i>Happy birthday dear Hyeon-a Happy birthday to you</i>
"00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:15,247",1.033,Cheers.
"00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,405",1.075,Bottoms up.
"00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,526",1.117,"Here, try some of this."
"00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,303",1.695,-Thank you. -Thank you.
"00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,500",1.945,What do you mean there are no guys?
"00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,650",1.365,There's a bunch right here.
"00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:37,372",2.688,It's because you look for someone who's worth 80 points.
"00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,722",3.267,"And even if you do find him, you grill him about the 20 points he lacks"
"00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:43,864",3.060,while you look for someone better. That's what you do.
"00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,685",1.737,Love is not for everyone.
"00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,131",1.364,Don't kid yourself.
"00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:53,170",4.673,"I mean, I go out with guys who are worth 20 points because I like them."
"00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,858",2.606,What's wrong with 20 points? That's 20 points above zero.
"00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,166",3.226,"If I get lucky and meet someone who's worth 30 points, I'm just grateful."
"00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,986",1.737,"And if it's 40points, then I've hit the jackpot."
"00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:06,692",4.424,"I mean, I'd understand if you're worth 80 points yourself."
"00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:09,835",2.480,Do you want me to be honest and tell you how many points you're worth?
"00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,944",2.025,Should I be brutally frank?
"00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:12,979",0.951,Hey.
"00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,031",2.688,"I'm just saying, you could use a little self-awareness."
"00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:19,926",2.812,Everyone else knows you except for you.
"00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,550",2.109,"Besides, you're not going to do it anyway."
"00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:27,329",1.695,You're not going to love just anyone.
"00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:32,540",1.902,That's enough. Why are you being so mean?
"00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:37,254",3.308,And why are you guys letting Gi-jeong do this to herself?
"00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,397",2.564,Mi-jeong. Why did you let it come to this?
"00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,920",2.440,You're at fault too. Knock some sense into her.
"00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:43,871",0.869,Hey.
"00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,683",2.150,Why are you so upset anyway?
"00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,199",2.234,We all waited for you to celebrate your birthday.
"00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,763",2.069,They came all the way here from Sanpo.
"00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:56,443",2.564,Do you want to stop seeing your hometown friends?
"00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,849",1.323,Were we too dense to notice?
"00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:01,819",0.951,It's not that.
"00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:02,812",0.910,Then what?
"00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,748",2.109,"It's her birthday. Cut her some slack, okay?"
"00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,684",2.440,Hyeon-a can do whatever she wants to do today.
"00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,379",1.612,Be as crabby as you want!
"00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,286",1.985,I'm going to break up with my boyfriend.
"00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:25,846",0.951,Why?
"00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,140",1.695,Forget it. I'm not even interested.
"00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,670",1.448,It's not the first time.
"00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,509",2.193,He says he's going to buy a bed…
"00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,607",2.109,when we've been together for over two years.
"00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,258",2.358,"I mean, you know beds aren't cheap."
"00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,434",3.597,"I'm supposed to buy one when we get married, so why would he buy it?"
"00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,032",2.895,It didn't occur to him because he's not planning to marry me.
"00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:06,871",1.282,Maybe he's just rich.
"00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,070",1.117,Yes.
"00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,713",2.191,That jerk has no money.
"00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:21,345",3.888,"And it's not even a double, it's a single. An 800,000-won single bed."
"00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:25,026",3.143,"That's crazy, isn't it? He wants to be single forever, right?"
"00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:33,462",3.598,-And he's 43 years old. -Right.
"00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:43,636",1.613,You want to get married?
"00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:46,572",0.910,Of course.
"00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:50,335",2.481,Can't I get married just because I prefer open relationships?
"00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:51,534",1.116,I'm open to anything.
"00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:53,933",1.779,I'm up for anything.
"00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,361",1.985,We've been together for two years.
"00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,546",1.406,"But even after two years,"
"00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,945",1.737,he still doesn't think I'm the one.
"00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:14,155",2.398,Just ask him if he's going to marry you or not.
"00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,637",1.861,"No, why would I do that?"
"00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,355",2.481,"By the way, who has he been talking to for so long?"
"00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:30,491",1.944,Is he on bad terms with his girlfriend?
"00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:32,931",1.117,They broke up.
"00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,240",1.324,They already broke up.
"00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,141",0.951,Who is it then?
"00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,337",1.364,It must be Byeon Sang-mi then.
"00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,017",1.488,Some convenience store owner.
"00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,044",1.447,She's the type of woman
"00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,650",2.523,who calls you whenever and yammers on for an hour
"00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,586",2.854,"complaining about her husband, her son, and so on."
"00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:01,466",2.730,You've got to be kidding me.
"00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,910",2.068,I hope somebody rescues him.
"00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,723",2.978,Hey! Why would you go in there?
"00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:33,723",1.654,Hey. What are you doing?
"00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,418",1.116,We're breaking up!
"00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,140",3.639,How could you ditch your girlfriend to talk to another woman for an hour?
"00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:40,960",1.737,Just go out with her instead then!

"00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,653",1.819,{\an8}<i>you start playing with your words.</i>
"00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:27,113",3.599,{\an8}<i>And once you start to enjoy drawing attention to yourself with your words…</i>
"00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:30,049",1.572,{\an8}<i>there's no turning back.</i>
"00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,342",1.902,{\an8}Do you think there's even a single thing
"00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:37,947",2.522,{\an8}coming out of my mouth that's actually worthwhile?
"00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,139",1.365,{\an8}There isn't. Not one.
"00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,060",1.199,{\an8}So I don't
"00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:48,369",2.523,{\an8}want you to ever reach that point.
"00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:53,124",2.398,{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm taking a detour</i>
"00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,523",2.315,{\an8}<i>because I'm too afraid to walk on the right path.</i>
"00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,997",2.234,{\an8}<i>But I've come so far away</i>
"00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,636",2.026,{\an8}<i>that I can't even dare to turn back.</i>
"00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:06,814",1.282,{\an8}<i>I like</i>
"00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:10,659",3.184,{\an8}<i>that you don't try to get attention from people with your words.</i>
"00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:16,284",4.260,{\an8}<i>That's why each and every word you utter is so special.</i>

"00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,747",3.638,and decided to live recklessly if I were born again. And that's me now.
"00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:04,338",3.639,Then I'll realize that this isn't right either
"00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,060",3.101,and decide to have a quiet life the next time around.
"00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,135",0.992,And that's you.
"00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:15,173",4.425,You and I have been switching back and forth millions of times.
"00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:17,613",1.364,Why are you acting so naive?

"00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,926",2.067,<i>As bright and cheery as a sunny day.</i>

"00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,857",3.888,"God, it's cold. Aren't you cold? I think you set the temperature too low."
"00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,619",2.439,"Well, adding a shelf to everything won't really work."
"00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:31,349",2.646,You still need to be able to see the mirror.
"00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:33,665",2.233,So how about just doing this one and that one?
"00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:37,180",3.432,I think about 30cm should do it.
"00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:44,707",2.770,"Hey, did you really break up because of me?"
"00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,967",2.606,It was about time we did anyway. Don't worry about it.
"00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,068",1.613,What have I done?
"00:35:55,335 --> 00:36:00,008",4.673,Why don't I call your girlfriend and try to explain things?
"00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,144",2.854,"Which works better for you, the 25th or the 27th?"
"00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:06,005",1.779,For the maintenance team to come.
"00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:14,565",0.909,Hello?
"00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:16,840",0.827,Yes.
"00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,156",0.993,I see.
"00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:22,051",2.813,The plastic chair was spinning around because of the wind
"00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,400",3.267,and dinged that car all by itself.
"00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:29,908",2.936,The owner said I'd have to sell this store if I was to pay for it.
"00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,390",2.399,"Jeez, what a load of crap."
"00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:34,995",1.902,He said his car was…
"00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:36,856",1.778,I've never even heard of it before.
"00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,751",1.448,I thought my life was over then.
"00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,679",3.183,Call me when something like that happens. Insurance covers all of that.
"00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:46,491",2.728,You looked like a god to me at that moment.
"00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:48,808",1.530,"Jeez, seriously."
"00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,743",2.853,"Mr. Yeom, we have to stick it out together until the end."
"00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:55,176",3.349,I'll replace the table with a wooden one with benches attached.
"00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,458",1.200,Thank you so much.
"00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:57,906",0.910,Mr. Yeom.
"00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:00,718",2.027,"You and I have to stay partners forever, okay?"
"00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,785",1.985,-Did you get the health certificate? -Right.
"00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,425",3.061,I told you you need to have it to put a coffee machine in the store.
"00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:08,616",1.364,I just don't have the time.
"00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,436",1.117,Can you ring this up?
"00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,346",0.827,Sure.
"00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,125",1.406,Why did you come? It's raining.
"00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:26,110",1.903,"Wait, hang on."
"00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,452",2.399,-Can I help you find something? -Wet wipes.
"00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,355",1.820,"They're over there, right there."
"00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:33,429",0.992,Okay.
"00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:37,607",1.076,We'll take this too--
"00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:44,182",1.117,"That'll be 9,000 won."
"00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,235",1.903,We should hurry and get out of Seoul.
"00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,844",1.324,Have a good day.
"00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:37,613",0.952,Are you working?
"00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:40,591",1.118,What are you doing here?
"00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,899",2.688,"There are no cameras around here, so I'm just killing time."
"00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:45,884",0.993,Did you have lunch?
"00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:47,662",1.158,Expired food.
"00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,027",1.282,Aren't you sick of it?
"00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:50,681",0.910,Not yet.
"00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:54,858",1.613,I wish I could work in an office.
"00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,504",1.777,I want to sit inside a building
"00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,309",3.721,where it's quiet even if there's a thunderstorm going on outside.
"00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,107",1.985,We've been working like this for eight years.
"00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:09,125",2.191,"If neither of us makes team leader this time,"
"00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,193",1.158,let's just quit.
"00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,453",1.903,We'll make it this time.
"00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:17,934",1.241,We have to.
"00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,476",1.696,-See you later. -Bye.
"00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,912",2.233,-Isn't it great? -How many tickets did he give you?
"00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,732",1.737,-Five. -Five?
"00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,634",1.820,"I've never won 5,000 won on the lottery."
"00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:38,529",2.812,-This is amazing. -Seriously. I've never--
"00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,051",1.777,I guess Mr. Park gave that to you.
"00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:43,823",0.828,Yes.
"00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,123",1.406,"You're the new hire with the management team, right?"
"00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,473",2.150,Yes. Nice to meet you.
"00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:56,518",3.846,"He said he was gifting you excitement when he gave it to you, right?"
"00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,372",1.985,That you'd be excited on Saturday.
"00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,018",1.571,How did you know that?
"00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:07,270",2.977,There isn't a single girl here who hasn't received a lottery ticket
"00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:08,676",1.322,from Mr. Park.
"00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,474",2.978,Why does he always give them on Mondays and not Fridays?
"00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:16,866",3.309,He wants you to think about him all week whenever you look at your ticket.
"00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,470",2.109,"It's such a cheap move, don't you think?"
"00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:20,587",1.033,"It costs 5,000 won."
"00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:26,046",3.019,But it still makes you pretty excited.
"00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:29,643",3.101,"On the weekend, you suddenly go, ""Right, the lottery ticket."""
"00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,215",0.993,Isn't that right?
"00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:36,633",0.910,Right.
"00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,679",3.144,"Apparently, he spends at least 50,000 won on lottery tickets every week."
"00:40:43,498 --> 00:40:45,152",1.654,Isn't he a pretty good boss?
"00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,171",2.937,I like it better than coffee.
"00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:14,101",2.606,"<i>Again, he's given lottery tickets to everyone but me.</i>"
"00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:20,387",4.301,He's given them to married women and new employees.
"00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,266",3.183,He's given them to everyone but me.
"00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:31,842",3.640,Just ask him straight up why he keeps on leaving you out.
"00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:47,723",2.151,I just want to get a call from anyone…
"00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,733",1.860,and talk about anything.
"00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,572",1.530,You've been talking all this time.
"00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:58,764",1.530,You talk all the time.
"00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:01,245",1.654,You still want to talk more?
"00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:06,787",2.109,I've never said what I really wanted to say.
"00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:13,776",2.770,I don't want to just say things to feel like I exist.
"00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:16,961",1.737,I want to talk to relax.
"00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:20,848",1.117,A conversation…
"00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:30,111",3.722,Words that make you feel relaxed.
"00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:36,770",1.944,"I say I want to have sex,"
"00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,195",2.606,"but the truth is, I want to talk with a man."
"00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:01,045",1.158,Yes.
"00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,489",1.654,<i>Why are you asking about Chan-hyeok?</i>
"00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,451",2.770,I want to ask him something but I can't reach him.
"00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:17,463",1.985,"<i>He's been borrowing money here and there,</i>"
"00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,448",1.903,<i>so things have gotten awkward for everyone.</i>
"00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,238",3.970,<i>I had a bad feeling when he started to boast about starting his own business.</i>
"00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:28,463",2.522,<i>I heard he closed his business and went to Thailand.</i>
"00:43:29,249 --> 00:43:31,896",2.647,<i>He couldn't carry on here because of his bad credit.</i>
"00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:35,205",2.688,<i>And who did he go to? I bet he went to Se-yeong.</i>
"00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,761",2.440,<i>Some say Se-yeong suggested it first.</i>
"00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,814",3.474,<i>They broke up and got back together over and over. Now it's come to this.</i>
"00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,239",1.779,<i>But why do you need to talk to him?</i>
"00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:50,506",1.117,It's nothing.
"00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,367",1.241,"Come on, tell me."
"00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:54,434",1.116,It's nothing.
"00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:56,627",1.324,<i>Don't tell me</i>
"00:43:57,454 --> 00:43:59,273",1.819,<i>you went out with him.</i>
"00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:02,912",1.033,Of course not.
"00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,916",1.406,He walked me to my house.
"00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,093",2.481,But he's… What do I do if he's not replying anymore?
"00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,664",1.488,You'll find out in the end.
"00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:15,608",0.910,I have a blind date.
"00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:18,420",0.992,He's a dermatologist.
"00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,777",2.274,-What if he keeps staring at my skin? -No way.
"00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,879",3.018,It was great when we were eating. He even took me home.
"00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,511",2.192,-But he won't return your texts? -Correct.
"00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:31,116",1.985,Maybe he doesn't check his phone.
"00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,556",2.357,"Please, in this day and age?"
"00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:34,466",0.827,Hey.
"00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:36,286",1.158,Should I text him again?
"00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:37,733",1.365,Should I text him?
"00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:40,462",2.646,"Hey, isn't Mi-jeong adorable?"
"00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,158",1.613,-She is. -Yes.
"00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:44,308",2.067,She's so cute.
"00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:45,260",0.868,She's cute.
"00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:47,493",2.150,She's very cute.
"00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:58,163",4.177,"<i>When I was in the first grade, I once scored 20 out of 100 on a test.</i>"
"00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:04,490",2.936,<i>I was told to get my parents' signatures on the test.</i>
"00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:06,930",1.944,<i>I couldn't bring myself to show them.</i>
