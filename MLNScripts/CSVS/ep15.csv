"00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,478",1.530,What's your name?
"00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,027",2.935,It's Gu Ja-gyeong.
"00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,866",1.943,How did you get my phone number?
"00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:28,760",1.322,I went to your house.
"00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,302",0.992,When?
"00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,990",1.199,A few days ago.
"00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:38,935",1.200,Why all of a sudden?
"00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,912",0.952,Just because.
"00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:47,908",2.026,You must have heard my mom passed away.
"00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:50,721",0.828,Yes.
"00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,409",1.779,And that my dad got remarried.
"00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,270",0.869,What is it?
"00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,612",1.033,It's just strange.
"00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,045",2.275,"So this day came, after all."
"00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:19,545",4.673,"""When might we meet again, and how? Will we ever meet again?"""
"00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,309",2.854,"""I'd be so happy if he called me right now."""
"00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,030",2.812,"When I was sincerely wishing for it, I never heard from you,"
"00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,974",1.861,"and when I least expected it, you…"
"00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,992",1.322,What were you doing?
"00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,591",1.324,Preparing for war.
"00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:38,692",2.315,I was ready to bring out my evil side today.
"00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:40,553",0.951,Against who?
"00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:47,790",2.316,"Where are we going, by the way?"
"00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,850",1.819,"Good point. Well, it's cold, right?"
"00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,456",1.737,Shall we go inside somewhere? A cafe?
"00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,392",1.075,Are you cold?
"00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,790",2.315,No. What about you?
"00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,686",2.192,"I'm alright, too. Let's just walk."
"00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:06,483",3.350,It'll be awkward sitting face to face with a cup of coffee.
"00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,287",1.571,"Now that I think of it,"
"00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:14,009",2.688,I've never had a cup of coffee with you at a cafe.
"00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,566",2.398,Of course not. How could we while we were there?
"00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,495",3.350,We just drank cold water after picking cabbages and radish.
"00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,657",1.489,"Just as I thought,"
"00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,303",1.737,we suit the fields better.
"00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:33,446",0.992,It's comfortable.
"00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,954",3.681,"Trees, wind, and rocks don't irritate us."
"00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,992",4.011,I get irritable when I'm in places with a lot of people.
"00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,492",4.094,Even someone sitting alone at a table next to mine in a café irritates me.
"00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,842",2.109,Even though they're not doing anything.
"00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,185",1.945,Maybe we just hate people.
"00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,816",1.530,I thought I was the only one.
"00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,027",2.978,"If someone comes your way when you're walking like this,"
"00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,805",1.695,don't they irritate you?
"00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,881",1.902,Do you think he was irritated by us too?
"00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,001",3.225,"When it's one against many, it's always the one that gets irritated."
"00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,855",2.026,The many don't really care.
"00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,735",3.143,But the one is always on their guard. Since they're alone.
"00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,138",1.406,I get weird when I'm with you.
"00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,487",1.903,I keep saying things I never thought of.
"00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,228",2.936,Are we a two? Or just one against one?
"00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,296",1.572,Are you drawing a line between us?
"00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,978",1.903,Why didn't you call me sooner?

"00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,761",1.613,-Thank you. -Thank you.
"00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,194",1.200,Put it in my bag.
"00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,578",0.868,There…
"00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,597",0.910,Is it good?
"00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,966",2.646,"Excuse me, would you mind moving this so we can sit here?"
"00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:50,876",0.828,Sure…
"00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,211",1.572,The <i>gimbap</i> is really good here.

"00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,724",1.406,Today's Saturday.
"00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,006",1.324,I got it. I'll call you back.
"00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,747",0.828,What is it?
"00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,529",2.358,"Just go. You can come back, can't you?"
"00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:57,416",0.993,I'll come back.
"00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,627",3.019,I'll be back soon. I'll come back. Go and wait somewhere.
"00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,488",1.199,Take your time.
"00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:05,935",0.868,I'll be back soon.
"00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,641",1.613,-Let's get out. -Sir?
"00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,254",1.530,"-Let's run. -Yes, sir."
"00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,717",0.827,What?
"00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,817",2.564,-Stop. -You son of a bitch!
"00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,768",0.869,"Let me go, you…"
"00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,945",4.095,"Let go of me, damn it. How dare you? You got me fired."
"00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,302",2.275,"I'll report all of you, you bastards. Let go of me!"
"00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,997",1.613,"Let go of me, you bastards!"
"00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,215",4.135,"She's been here drinking since the early evening, yelling that she got fired."
"00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,103",1.943,I knew she was going to cause trouble.
"00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,411",1.075,Let go of me!

"00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,921",2.193,But you're upset we came to your workplace?
"00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,883",3.391,"Was I supposed to go to you and gently ask, ""Please pay me,"" then?"
"00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,067",1.820,Why? Tell me.
"00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:18,154",3.805,Why do I have to be respectful of you when you weren't from the beginning?
"00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:19,850",0.828,Why?
"00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,297",0.868,Why?
"00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,955",1.736,"Hey, Ja-gyeong."
"00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,610",1.572,Ja-gyeong.
"00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:34,862",3.475,"Mr. Gu, there weren't that many customers yesterday, for real."
"00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,922",2.151,This is all! I swear.
"00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,396",2.275,"Check the CCTV footage if you want, you bastard!"
"00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:43,298",1.820,"Hey, Ja-gyeong. Wait!"
"00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,167",0.868,Why?
"00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,558",1.777,To play cards all night again?
"00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,018",1.489,"I didn't mean to do it,"
"00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,582",1.943,but the gambling debt I racked up before…
"00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,683",2.564,They'll kill me if I don't pay it back by today.
"00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:51,534",1.861,You must be losing your touch.
"00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,974",1.530,You've been cut.
"00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,729",1.447,"It was a bottle, sir."
"00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,144",4.219,You must be drinking every day. Except for maybe a few hours a week?
"00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,378",1.779,YEOM MI-JEONG: TAKE YOUR TIME
"00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,363",0.992,"Where to, sir?"

"00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,887",1.778,You've come back as a different person
"00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,996",1.406,in just an hour and a half.
"00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:50,685",0.952,{\an8}Hey.
"00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,455",1.324,{\an8}That's life.
"00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,260",1.820,{\an8}Just when you think it's going well…
"00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,865",2.026,{\an8}I've never even had one whole perfect day.
"00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,692",1.240,{\an8}Five minutes a day.
"00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:15,167",2.193,"{\an8}If you have five minutes of peace, it's bearable."
"00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:22,073",3.267,{\an8}When I hold the door open for a kid at a convenience store
"00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,671",3.515,"{\an8}and the kid says, ""Thank you,"" that makes me happy for seven seconds."
"00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:30,302",3.391,"{\an8}When I open my eyes in the morning and remember it's Saturday,"
"00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,701",1.654,{\an8}that makes me happy for ten seconds.
"00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,679",2.027,{\an8}Fill up five minutes a day like that.
"00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,311",2.482,{\an8}That's how I survive.
"00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:57,928",0.951,{\an8}Well…
"00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,120",1.200,{\an8}do you still
"00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:02,849",1.447,"{\an8}live the hard way,"
"00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,612",1.985,{\an8}trudging on step by step?
"00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:21,790",1.034,Let's go together.
"00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,767",1.240,"Step by step,"
"00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,538",1.571,trudging on.
"00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,812",1.199,Excuse me.
"00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:30,764",0.869,"Yes, sir."
"00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,349",1.118,"A while ago,"
"00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,367",2.068,people had to abandon their cars and walk
"00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,262",2.151,because of the heavy snow.
"00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,289",1.448,I remember.
"00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,514",2.564,I also had to leave my car on Yeongdong Bridge and walk.
"00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,789",1.696,"And I suddenly thought,"
"00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:26,345",2.440,"""If the earth just stopped for a while like this,"

"00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:44,996",4.715,"I was heading there in my head, figuring out where to make turns."
"00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:46,899",1.158,It was funny
"00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,786",3.308,"that I was thinking about walking there if the Earth stopped,"
"00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,936",2.067,when I could just drive there.
"00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:01,414",1.199,Do you remember
"00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,005",3.805,the guy who borrowed my money and left the country to go back to his ex?
"00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,520",2.233,You never told me he went to his ex.
"00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,779",3.060,It was that jerk's wedding today.
"00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,693",3.598,He still owes me six million won.
"00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:22,506",2.730,But he still managed to pay for all the preparations required
"00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:23,581",0.993,and had a buffet.
"00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:28,295",3.804,"So I said if he had that much money, he should pay me back."
"00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,645",2.317,Then he ranted at me for half an hour.
"00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,092",1.364,"While I was listening to him,"
"00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,988",2.151,I broke the cup I was holding.
"00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,465",3.680,He must have thought I was the same Yeom Mi-jeong he remembered.
"00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,758",1.447,I decided to go to his wedding
"00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,480",3.143,and stand behind the bride and groom with a really scary expression

"00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,467",1.075,There are too many.
"00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,501",1.571,This place is freezing!
"00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,182",1.157,It's broken.

"00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,589",1.697,You called in the end.
"00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:18,461",2.068,But I was an asshole till yesterday?

"00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:53,950",2.316,she didn't think she'd get paid after a month.
"00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,499",3.970,So she quit after five days. She needs to get paid for those five days.
"00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,766",2.647,But they keep saying they'll pay her tomorrow.
"00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,157",3.308,So I'll go meet them in person. Calling them will never work.
"00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,465",2.688,"How shameless of them, trying to not pay her."
"00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,511",2.274,It might not be because they're shameless.
"00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,529",2.149,It might be because they don't have the money.
"00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,507",2.109,Are you taking their side as a store owner?
"00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:23,767",2.316,"I was once paid a salary, too."
"00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,620",2.770,So I know how it feels not to be paid in time.
"00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:31,169",3.432,But I'm now in no position to curse at people who can't pay their employees.
"00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:34,768",1.366,"When I was running a business,"
"00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,448",2.688,"if I could pay my employees by sacrificing one of my arms,"
"00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,467",2.234,I would have gladly done it.

"00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:59,291",2.564,"I was so frustrated and wanted to go somewhere to pray,"
"00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,061",2.191,but there weren't any churches open that early.
"00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,254",1.282,The only place I could go to
"00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,858",1.488,was a convenience store.
"00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:10,581",2.399,"And when I was sitting here, all depressed,"
"00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,103",1.819,I got a message from a colleague.
"00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:16,288",3.102,He asked if I wanted to run a convenience store in my neighborhood.
"00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:19,266",1.738,And that was this place.
"00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,739",1.282,That's who I am.
"00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,950",3.598,"I always know in advance where I belong, like a psychic."

"00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:35,188",3.391,Then go sit in some chairman's office of a big company tomorrow.
"00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,041",2.068,Tell them that's where you belong.
"00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,695",1.572,Tell them you just know it.
"00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,928",2.151,Instead of going to Gyeongbokgung Palace.
"00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:45,650",3.143,Why do you keep going to the palace where there's no chance?
"00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,677",1.324,Your last name isn't even Yi.
"00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,778",0.868,Take care.
"00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:41,397",0.952,Where's Gi-jeong?
"00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,464",1.198,She says she's busy.
"00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,717",2.854,I think I know why she's upset.
"00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:51,446",0.992,Me too.
"00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,615",1.778,All rise.
"00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,089",2.068,We'll sing hymn number 38.
"00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:08,691",3.184,I took a day off to attend the kid's graduation ceremony.
"00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,462",2.688,But she asked me why since I won't even be in the photos.
"00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:14,812",3.267,She said someone like me shouldn't be in a picture with her
"00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,011",1.117,"on her graduation day,"
"00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,576",2.482,"since if someone asks, ""Who's this lady?"" one day,"
"00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:21,139",2.481,"then she'll have to say, ""Someone my dad used to date."""
"00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:24,365",3.143,"I mean, how could she say that? When I'm right there with them."
"00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,598",1.240,Did I say anything wrong?
"00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,120",1.447,Tell her to know her place.
"00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:33,298",3.309,Only your family should come to your graduation.
"00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,110",2.193,Why would she be there when you're just dating?
"00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:39,501",2.647,But they're not just dating.
"00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,072",1.489,They're going to get married.
"00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:44,919",3.764,Then she should join when they're married. Who knows what will happen?
"00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,336",2.647,She still shouldn't have suddenly looked at her phone
"00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,569",2.150,"and left saying, ""I forgot I had plans."""
"00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,340",2.689,She was obviously lying
"00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,532",2.109,and showing that she was upset.
"00:28:57,614 --> 00:28:58,938",1.324,That was so immature.
"00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:01,750",1.572,And that wasn't the first time.
"00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:06,505",4.673,"When I raised my voice a bit, she said she forgot she had other plans."
"00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,235",2.067,Why does she forget about her plans every time?
"00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:12,544",2.606,"She should make up different excuses, at least."
"00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,727",3.101,She always has to show that she's upset.
"00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,705",1.860,Is she supposed to argue with you then?
"00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,709",1.530,Father's looking.
"00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:26,852",3.059,"Today, even those who get angry at their own siblings"
"00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:30,409",3.474,or call them idiots or dummies…
"00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:34,503",4.012,Just get married already without worrying about me.
"00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:38,597",0.951,Spit out your gum.
"00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:42,030",2.688,"Lastly, we will end the Mass"
"00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,842",2.730,-with the Prayer of Confession. -My lord.
"00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:46,744",1.819,"-I'm to blame, -I'm to blame."
"00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,473",2.646,-I'm to blame. It is my fault. -I'm to blame.
"00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,410",2.440,It's not the first time you've treated her like that.
"00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,477",1.985,But you've never apologized to her properly.
"00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,289",2.728,Do you think I do it for no reason? It's for Yu-rim's sake.
"00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,068",1.695,Stop using her as an excuse!
"00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:01,012",1.861,Or I'll move out with her.
"00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:05,271",4.177,"What? So Yu-rim's all grown up now, huh? Are you saying you don't need us anymore?"
"00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,339",1.447,Seriously…
"00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:21,483",0.952,I'm sorry.
"00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,295",1.779,I got too upset.
"00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:28,223",1.695,What do you want for lunch?
"00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,905",1.613,It's puberty.
"00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:49,108",2.606,Chang-hee just came back and had lunch with us.
"00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,175",1.075,Yes.
"00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:54,360",2.606,Mr. Gu visited.
"00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,461",1.116,<i>I…</i>
"00:30:57,544 --> 00:30:59,364",1.820,gave him your number.
"00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,887",1.945,Did he call you yet?
"00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,402",1.282,We met up.
"00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:11,026",2.441,I see. That's good.
"00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,417",1.241,Take care. Bye.
"00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,402",1.365,"Okay, take care, Dad."
"00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,034",1.324,Who did you meet?
"00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:05,325",5.624,CARD ISSUING OFFICE NO PHONES OR CAMERAS
"00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,394",1.531,It's like a blank check
"00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:32,330",2.853,since the card has the customer's personal information.
"00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:35,969",3.556,"So, the security tends to be tight here, even within the company."
"00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:39,071",3.019,"Even one misprint, and you'll require authorization to discard it."
"00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:43,041",2.978,About ten million cards are issued a year.
"00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:48,211",4.094,"Everyone owns more than one card, right? And they need another one if they lose it."
"00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,270",2.480,And there are about a thousand different kinds of cards.
"00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:56,936",3.267,"Once a card is launched, it's almost impossible to end the service."
"00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,790",2.771,Since there are cards organizations have used for a long time.
"00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:03,554",3.681,And the VIP cards are handcrafted one by one.
"00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:10,666",1.902,"A lot of work for the VIP department, too?"
"00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:11,866",1.117,"Yes, it's Monday."
"00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:21,460",0.951,Mi-jeong.
"00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:28,986",0.992,Let's go.
"00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,095",2.025,You look like you belong in Yeouido.
"00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:33,701",2.522,"Wherever you are, you always look like you belong there."
"00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:35,686",1.903,Even in Gangnam.
"00:33:36,637 --> 00:33:39,656",3.019,I also look like someone from Sanpo when I'm there.
"00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,634",1.696,"You live in Gangbuk now, though."
"00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:46,562",2.564,But it doesn't feel like my neighborhood yet.
"00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,875",2.812,"Compared to the workload, the salary isn't as high,"
"00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,646",2.151,but it's better than working at Joy Card.
"00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,499",2.770,They also don't treat permanent and temp workers differently.
"00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:04,883",3.722,"If I started my career at this company, I'd be an assistant manager by now."
"00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,060",2.482,I shouldn't have wasted my time at Joy Card.
"00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:13,112",1.488,Did you hear Han Su-jin left?
"00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,504",2.647,"I checked the job title chart, and Han Su-jin was gone."
