"00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,426",1.943,or a squirrel that drowned in a water tank.

"00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,408",1.365,But if a car went by then…
"00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,254",1.364,you'd hear them burst.
"00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,638",2.026,In the dead of the night…
"00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,067",1.779,"The next morning, you'd see"

"00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,909",3.184,But I don't know why they'd always cross the street at night.
"00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,368",2.398,Was the ground too hot for them during the day?

"00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,704",0.951,comes out.
"00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,095",0.993,And…
"00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:30,231",2.896,I have this feeling I've never had before.
"00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,359",1.241,Suddenly…
"00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,611",1.530,I feel lovable.
"00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:54,630",1.903,Who says something like that while eating?
"00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,233",1.860,Enjoy your lunch.
"00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,888",1.572,"-Thanks. -Well, then."
"00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:51,989",1.033,Is that why?
"00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:53,892",1.034,Yes.
"00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:56,870",1.075,You're so brave.
"00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,287",4.259,"I wanted to tell him how I felt, but I was still scared to do it."
"00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:05,389",2.275,So I had a backup plan in case I got rejected.
"00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,746",1.448,And this was the result.
"00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,434",1.861,"You seem better than I expected, though."
"00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:15,562",3.515,My face still gets red when I think about it.
"00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:19,904",3.721,But I can get over it by humming to myself.
"00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,799",0.868,You're amazing.
"00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,108",1.861,I haven't seen such a spirit in a while.
"00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,284",2.440,"To be honest, I feel okay"
"00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,221",2.274,"because of his attitude, you know?"
"00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:37,481",4.178,"You know, you told me I'm the type who cares about a guy's attitude."
"00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,300",1.737,So the reason it turned out that way--
"00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,699",1.820,Thanks for the food.
"00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,014",2.233,-Thank you. -Don't mention it.
"00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,421",1.324,Coffee's on me.
"00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,714",3.060,I turned my phone off that day because I was so embarrassed.
"00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,699",1.902,Why? In case he called you?
"00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:55,263",2.481,{\an8}No. In case he didn't.
"00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,985",1.819,{\an8}I thought it would be better not to know

"00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,578",1.695,"I had leeches on the back of my hand,"
"00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:09,762",3.101,and more appeared until my whole hand was covered in them.
"00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,334",1.489,"So I said,"
"00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:15,180",3.185,"""I have no blood, I'm a block of wood,"""
"00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,537",2.275,"and all of them just fell off, totally powerless."
"00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,308",1.200,What a weird dream.
"00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,451",1.034,Don't you guys dream?
"00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,477",1.943,I have at least three dreams a night.
"00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,049",1.489,-Hey. -What?
"00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,075",1.943,So this is where you guys were.
"00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,929",1.613,Have you been waiting long?
"00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:33,624",0.868,Not at all.
"00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:36,684",1.282,Table for two?
"00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,324",0.868,Can we go first?
"00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:43,550",1.448,"Sure, go ahead."
"00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,866",2.234,All right. Thank you.
"00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,081",1.159,"""I am"

"00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,709",0.910,Seriously.
"00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,066",2.275,Why are the tables at that restaurant all so small?
"00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:22,258",2.109,"Once you put your phone and wallet on it,"
"00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,077",1.737,there's no space left to put your cup.
"00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,386",3.226,"And you have to eat so carefully, like this."
"00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,206",1.737,Why do we have to eat like that?
"00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,631",1.365,"What did you have, Chang-hee?"
"00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,544",1.777,I asked what you ate.
"00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:40,537",0.910,Kimchi stew.
"00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,349",2.109,-At Mr. Park's place? -Yes.
"00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,237",3.805,You should have told me if you were going to eat kimchi stew there!
"00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,717",1.901,"I'd have gone there, too."
"00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,357",2.481,It seems the queue there wasn't too long today.
"00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,928",1.488,Seeing as you came back early.
"00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,932",1.406,What will you have tomorrow?
"00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,372",2.356,I don't know what I'll want to eat tomorrow.
"00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,681",3.226,How about you eat the kimchi stew there again tomorrow?
"00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,290",1.861,-Do you like me? -What?
"00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,392",1.861,Why do you follow me around?
"00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,294",1.323,What?
"00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,279",1.902,When did I follow you around?
"00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,057",1.695,Are you a narcissist?
"00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,001",1.860,That's ridiculous.
"00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,532",1.448,It's ridiculous for me too.
"00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,370",3.143,I'm not even your boyfriend. Why do I have to queue for you?
"00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,761",2.026,When did I ask you to queue for me?
"00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,739",2.895,I was just asking. I can't even do that?
"00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,716",2.895,Asking me if I could have kimchi stew again tomorrow
"00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,611",2.812,sounds like you're asking me if I could queue for you.
"00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:46,333",2.936,"For office workers, a nice lunch is the only thing we can enjoy."
"00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,318",1.903,Why do I have to give that up just for you?
"00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,724",1.324,Are we that close?
"00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,051",2.150,"Why don't you queue for me tomorrow, then?"
"00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,236",2.606,I think I'll want to have Pyongyang <i>naengmyeon</i> tomorrow.
"00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,676",2.358,Will you queue at Yaksan Naengmyeon for me?
"00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:04,984",1.530,Why do you ask people
"00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,672",2.605,for something you're not willing to do for them?
"00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,665",1.447,What's your problem?
"00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,113",1.365,"I mean,"
"00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:25,331",3.433,"if you want to eat kimchi stew, is asking that we go together"
"00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,109",1.696,something to get this angry about?
"00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:31,120",3.143,"I said, I don't know what I'll want to have tomorrow."
"00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,874",2.441,"Hey, stop! Pull over."
"00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,396",1.158,Damn it.
"00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,266",0.993,Damn it.
"00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:41,218",0.869,What's wrong?
"00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:43,203",1.406,It seems there was an accident.
"00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:37,998",1.075,It's really you.
"00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:46,062",1.654,What are you doing here?
"00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:17,001",2.646,Golf went strangely well for me today.
"00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:20,392",2.564,"So I thought, ""This must be my lucky day."""
"00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,329",1.945,And it turns out it is!

"00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,483",1.613,yet I bumped into you on the road.
"00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,175",3.515,What are you doing here? Are you putting on a show? Acting like you're broken?
"00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,194",1.076,A show?
"00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,796",1.903,Why do I have to act like I'm broken?

"00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,488",1.158,But it was your girl.
"00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:20,854",2.772,You must have been acting.

"00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,333",1.737,How did you not cry at all?
"00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:16,021",2.109,How could a human be like that?

"00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:24,871",1.902,Of course not. She's your little sister.

"00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,591",1.820,{\an8}You won't hate Jeong A-reum anymore.
"00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,264",0.993,{\an8}If I get rich?
"00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,302",1.324,{\an8}Why would I hate anyone?
"00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:48,577",2.193,"{\an8}When I have enough, why would I?"
"00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,802",2.150,Why are you saying something so obvious?
"00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:56,682",1.075,If I get rich…
"00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,396",2.357,"Well, I'll probably hate her just a little."
"00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,510",1.034,I mean…
"00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:21,206",1.613,Did I say something wrong?
"00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,499",2.564,"I need to tell him the truth, don't I?"
"00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:27,822",1.240,We're friends.
"00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,737",1.571,Let's go!
"00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:12,073",3.888,I'm not even some hero trying to save his country.
"00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:15,174",2.316,Why do I feel so ashamed?
"00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:23,362",3.018,"SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS"
"00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,278",1.654,Aren't you going to change the rope?
"00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:21,218",1.075,"Oh, dear."
"00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:40,118",2.109,"I might be living like this,"
"00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,212",3.060,but there are plenty of people in the sink business
"00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,569",2.274,who drive expensive cars and play golf.
"00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:52,028",3.185,I just made a mistake standing surety for someone.
"00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:57,114",3.308,"But thanks to this business, I managed to pay off that debt"
"00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:01,332",4.134,and hold onto my land and house.
"00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:13,615",4.053,"If you do this work steadily, you'll have a good life."
"00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,402",1.282,I'll go buy a new rope.
"00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,355",1.242,Everything…
"00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,897",2.730,looks bizarre when it's on the ground.
"00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:21,686",2.771,"It's just a nail,"
"00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,291",2.026,but why does it look like a woman's dead body?
"00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,641",1.241,That's creepy.
"00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,453",0.868,Whose is it?
"00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:31,694",1.158,I don't know.
"00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,811",2.688,"I went to the mall for a change, but it only ruined my mood."
"00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:47,450",2.978,Are they that great? Why are they laughing so loud?
"00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:49,725",1.738,I felt so small all by myself.
"00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,751",1.447,Go with me next time.
"00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:55,390",2.729,"I just went to buy a stick of lipstick, damn it."
"00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,538",1.241,Why do I
"00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:20,699",4.921,hate other women my age who shop in groups at the mall so much?
"00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:23,512",1.695,Because they're there to spend money.
"00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,490",2.069,They must have husbands. And kids too.
"00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:28,929",1.282,"In front of those women,"
"00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:33,188",3.680,I want to make them feel small by buying something too expensive for them.
"00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:38,193",4.384,"I want to have a body that the sexiest, coolest clothes would look good on."
"00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:42,907",3.556,I hate seeing a family of four even more than those women who shop in groups.
"00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,769",1.779,Those perfect fortresses.
"00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,400",2.109,"We also came from families, you know?"
"00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,467",1.985,"Hey, we never go anywhere as a family."
"00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:54,570",3.019,Why would we? Seeing each other at home is already more than enough.
"00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,765",2.440,The family we'll have one day…
"00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,604",3.391,Will it be the same as the family we came from?
"00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,428",1.903,It's all the same.
"00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:18,597",4.384,But you still want to do it. Humans are so dumb.
"00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,849",1.820,-Hello. -Hello.
"00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,041",2.109,There you go. Time to go home.
"00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:27,860",0.868,-Bye. -Bye.
"00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:28,853",0.910,-Yu-rim! -Let's go.
"00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,507",1.572,-Did you study hard? -Yes.
"00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,286",1.696,"-Goodbye. -All right, goodbye."
"00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:34,353",1.985,-Should I carry your bag? -It's okay.
"00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,710",2.275,Let's go home. Auntie made deep-fried squid.
"00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,741",1.448,Your auntie
"00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:47,793",3.101,borrowed all the books you need from the library.
"00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:51,887",1.530,"Studying is hard, right?"
"00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:58,877",5.211,"Why do you always say ""auntie did this,"" ""auntie did that"" when you talk to me?"
"00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:05,948",1.116,Just in case
"00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,802",1.903,"people think I'm your mom,"
"00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,779",1.737,and that makes you upset.
"00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:19,348",3.143,"Your mom's so much prettier than me, you know?"
"00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:40,728",1.116,Is it good?
"00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,518",3.020,"I envy you. You have aunties,"
"00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,627",2.027,who cook delicious meals for you.
"00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,157",1.447,My auntie was…
"00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,142",1.902,Go and sleep if you're drunk.
"00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,158",1.985,Aunties are all you've got.
"00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:04,714",2.977,Your aunties have decided to give up on being women.
"00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,064",2.647,But your dad…
"00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,289",1.199,he's still a man.
"00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,617",1.324,"I know everything, you punk."
"00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,234",1.944,Did that girl ask you for a Chanel?
"00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:26,219",1.903,You've never bought us lipstick.
"00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,471",1.778,I already saw that thing in your trunk.
"00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,666",2.812,Do you think something in a Chanel bag has to be from Chanel?
"00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:40,527",1.158,It's a toolbox.
"00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,938",1.861,"Cho Gyeong-seon, go to your room and sleep,"
"00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,460",2.440,He's definitely seeing someone.
"00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,231",2.110,"Lately, he's been looking at his phone all day."
"00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:53,844",1.530,He changes the pattern lock now.
"00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,202",2.275,"Hey, you never used the pattern lock before, right?"
"00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,336",2.398,See? I'm right.
"00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,239",1.820,That punk's seeing someone.
"00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,927",2.606,"Hey! Show me your phone, you bastard!"
"00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,540",1.531,Gosh!
"00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,187",2.068,I told you not to swear at him. He's a father.
"00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:17,127",2.399,What about me?
"00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,619",5.955,I'm an auntie. And I'll be forty very soon!
"00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:32,676",0.909,YEOM GI-JEONG
"00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,455",1.696,THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY CONSIDERATE.
"00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:40,286",1.324,ARE YOU OKAY?
"00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:42,353",1.985,DELETE
"00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:46,779",3.433,I'M FINE. THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
"00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:51,286",2.564,I'M TOUCHED. LET'S DRINK AGAIN SOMETIME.
"00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:56,580",1.241,DELETE FOR ME THE MESSAGE WILL ONLY BE DELETED
"00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,986",1.324,FROM YOUR CHATROOM AND WILL STILL BE VISIBLE TO YOUR FRIEND(S)
"00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,535",1.324,DELETE
"00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,217",2.730,"I've seen a fake nail on the window sill of a bus once,"
"00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,581",1.282,and it felt so weird.
"00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:33,014",2.772,It's bizarre when you see a thing somewhere it doesn't belong.
"00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,596",1.860,"A bird lying on the ground,"
"00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:40,871",1.447,a man hanging in a tree…
"00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,040",1.406,even a dog on a farm.
"00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:54,725",1.571,How come you didn't drink today?
"00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,966",1.365,3 MISSED CALLS
"00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,737",2.688,WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING AGAIN? I HEARD YOU MET BAEK. WHAT HAPPENED?
"00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,283",1.200,Why won't you answer it?
"00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:33,764",1.241,I don't have to.
"00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:37,899",1.653,"Are you tired today, too?"
"00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,550",0.951,What is it?
"00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:48,776",1.447,You told them we were dating.
"00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:53,201",0.869,Yes.
"00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:56,551",1.034,Why did you do that?
"00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:59,032",1.778,You don't even know when I'll leave.
"00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,096",2.151,This could've passed without anyone knowing.
"00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:13,714",2.317,It's not a big deal for people to date and break up.
"00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,078",1.282,Why keep it a secret?
"00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,718",1.613,I'll leave after eating some.
"00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,812",2.482,So say what you want to say if you have anything.
"00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:43,819",0.950,A long time ago…
"00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,587",1.489,I this saw on TV.
"00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:58,831",3.846,There's this famous cliff in the US where people commit suicide.
"00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:04,083",3.804,And they interviewed people who survived after jumping off that cliff.
"00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:06,979",1.406,They all said…
"00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:11,569",2.647,"when you reach two-thirds of the way down the cliff,"
"00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,877",2.274,"whatever made you want to kill yourself,"
"00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:17,896",1.985,didn't feel like anything anymore.
"00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,122",1.696,"Just a few seconds ago,"
"00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:25,753",3.597,they thought dying was the only way out and jumped.
"00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,731",1.281,"But in just a few seconds,"
"00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:30,716",0.868,that feeling
"00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:34,438",2.109,started to feel like nothing.
"00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,965",1.820,I thought it would be the same for her.
"00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,604",1.365,So I told her.
"00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,800",2.812,"""To a person who feels like living is so painful,"
"00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,481",1.282,getting therapy
"00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:00,285",2.274,is reaching two-thirds of your way down a cliff
"00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,357",4.508,"without ending up killing yourself."""
"00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:09,921",0.951,And…
"00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,827",1.861,that she should see a therapist.
"00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:19,598",0.951,I told her that.
"00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:21,624",0.867,But…
"00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:24,933",1.324,she just jumped and died.
"00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:40,441",0.910,Who did?
"00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:44,288",1.076,The woman…
"00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,100",1.490,The woman I used to live with.
"00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,231",2.812,"<i>You told her that because you wanted her dead, didn't you?</i>"
"00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,671",1.861,She was already vulnerable.
"00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,194",1.778,"And you encouraged her, didn't you?"
"00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:09,017",2.564,Yes. I was telling her to die.
"00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:17,744",1.282,It was so…
"00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,443",3.432,frustrating to see her suffer so much.
"00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:37,553",1.614,I'll stop if you tell me to.
"00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:40,861",0.952,The worshiping…
"00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,451",1.240,You can take it back.
"00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:01,828",1.530,When did you ever worship me?
"00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:57,534",4.260,"You bastard. It's you that killed her, but I can't sue you for it."
"00:47:58,071 --> 00:48:00,759",2.688,Saying you told someone to die won't fly in court.
"00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:01,793",0.951,What do I do then?
"00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:04,895",1.654,I've got to kill you myself.
"00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,075",1.737,Come on. I didn't hide that hard.
"00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,019",0.993,Okay?
"00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:19,493",3.391,"I waited with my door open, but you never came."
"00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:24,290",2.399,You were so quiet after taking all of my business.
"00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:29,005",1.779,You don't care about that at all.
"00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,901",2.399,Did you two have sweet dreams?
"00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:38,450",2.606,They should just announce it at nine in the morning.
"00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:41,096",2.564,But at 5 p.m.? Are they teasing us on purpose?
"00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,446",2.771,"But if they did it in the morning, it'd affect your work."
