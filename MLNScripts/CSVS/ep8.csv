"00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,729",2.919,We shouldn't have unpacked it. Don't pack like this next time.

"00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,424",2.627,How great would it be? If it was approved by the country.
"00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:25,513",4.421,There should also be a day where you reject someone politely and considerately.

"00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,688",1.126,"""I love you."""
"00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:36,315",2.544,The country could also tell you how to reject someone.

"00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,178",2.210,Don't drag the country into this.
"00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:11,183",4.921,"Well, they make new policies for the minority and the weak all the time."
"00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,853",2.586,So how come there's no system that protects the minority
"00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,646",1.710,and the weak in the world of dating?
"00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,691",2.961,You can't expect the country to look after your faint heart too.
"00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,402",2.628,"I'm saying, there should be a culture like this."
"00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:25,364",3.879,"""I'm expressing my feelings for you"

"00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:36,000",3.295,"You're telling people you like them, not hate them. What's wrong with it?"
"00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,377",1.793,Let's say it's approved by the country.

"00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:42,798",1.209,Let your soul answer.

"00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,884",2.919,But he woke up in the middle of the night shivering in the cold
"00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:29,595",2.627,and found himself sprawled out in a bush.
"00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:33,140",2.794,"He got a call from his friend, and he asked,"
"00:30:33,224 --> 00:30:35,059",1.835,"""Where am I? Why am I lying here?"""

"00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,847",2.795,I'll give it a go and see if it works or not.
"00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,840",3.087,Just give me a little push and I'll fall on my own.
"00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,258",1.335,Cut it out!

"00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:11,286",1.001,and transparent.
"00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,127",1.210,Transparent?
"00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:20,295",1.042,You're crazy.
"00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:23,590",1.001,You are transparent.
"00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:31,765",1.460,Are you worshiping me right now?
"00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,767",0.917,Yes.

"00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,628",1.042,Yes.
"00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:02,629",0.917,Why?
"00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,799",1.710,Because you might miss the promotion?
"00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,094",2.502,Or are you expanding your career path?
"00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:11,680",1.209,"Well, yes."
"00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,061",2.794,Do you know eight people applied for it from our branch alone?
"00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:21,440",2.795,"They're hiring 3, but 67 people applied."
"00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:23,400",1.877,Have you ever beaten such odds?
"00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:26,653",2.627,I beat the odds of one in 100 million when I was conceived.
"00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:32,284",3.837,"Anyway, your chance of getting promoted is one in ten."
"00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,287",2.920,So it's much better to go all-in on the promotion.
"00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,080",1.710,Isn't it unreasonable to give up
"00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:39,416",2.252,the odds of one in ten and go for one in twenty?
"00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:44,838",3.587,"When you're driven into a corner, you can't even do simple math."
"00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,092",1.126,What are you working on?

"00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:59,092",3.128,"You're not in the same department, and he wouldn't use it against you."
"00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:00,177",1.001,So what's the problem?
"00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:05,599",3.295,You do all kinds of stuff with a man whose name you don't even know.
"00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:07,559",1.877,I can't even tell a guy that I like him?
"00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,271",2.211,"Don't push me, or I'll tell him to worship me."
"00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,495",1.752,Eat before you go.
"00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:29,706",2.544,Don't starve to look thin. You'll sweat a lot again.
"00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:45,096",2.919,I listened to this every single day back in high school.
"00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,893",3.712,"When I listened to their music, it took me somewhere before I knew it."
"00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,063",2.294,"I wanted to hold on to that feeling,"
"00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,525",2.753,so I listened to it over and over again.
"00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:00,987",1.293,Like some kind of addict.
"00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:05,200",2.211,I think I know what you mean.
"00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,036",2.753,I've been listening to it over the last few days.
"00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,746",1.627,The first track made me feel
"00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,457",2.627,like something was boiling up from deep down inside.
"00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,419",3.211,"I used to think it was noisy, so I didn't listen to this kind of music."
"00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,006",2.377,"But this time, I felt something surging up within me."
"00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,843",2.753,"I didn't know what it was, but I could feel it."
"00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:26,847",2.294,Right? Although you don't know what it is.
"00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:39,234",2.711,Getting to know someone is an amazing thing.
"00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,028",1.793,It's not just that person.
"00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:45,240",3.128,It's like they bring several universes with them.
"00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:51,246",3.003,"For example, a universe called Nirvana."
"00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,005",1.168,I'm so excited.
"00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,053",1.960,I can't wait to go home
"00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:09,014",0.918,and listen to it.
"00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,105",0.834,Hey.
"00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:20,150",1.085,"No, I won't be long."
"00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,068",0.876,Bye.
"00:44:34,956 --> 00:44:35,790",0.834,How's it looking?
"00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,047",2.670,I have a feeling that he's from Seoul.
"00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,428",3.045,I hope Gi-jeong won't need us to do this.
"00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:51,848",2.920,But she has us here because she thinks it won't go well.
"00:44:52,682 --> 00:44:54,726",2.044,"With this, your instincts are usually right."
"00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,021",3.212,That's what I've been telling you every day.
"00:44:58,104 --> 00:44:59,814",1.710,You get it now that it's about her?
"00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,984",1.334,"Gosh, humans…"
"00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:09,199",3.170,I can't do it. I shouldn't have come here.
"00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,327",2.086,I can't believe I'm actually here.
"00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,547",1.459,What the hell.
"00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,593",1.168,Watch for her signal.
"00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,266",2.168,Please choose a date and let me know.
"00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:37,519",0.834,Okay.
"00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,437",0.917,Get home safely.
"00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:46,361",0.876,Wait.
"00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:48,071",0.834,Yes?
"00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,491",1.001,It's nothing.
"00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:56,871",1.334,Wait.
"00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:04,421",2.378,I'm sorry. Never mind. Bye.
"00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:08,550",1.001,"No, wait."
"00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:15,682",4.421,"When there's something I want to say, it's hard for me to hold it back."
"00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:19,227",3.462,"I'll probably say this sooner or later, so I'll just do it now."
"00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,480",0.959,Would you…
"00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:27,402",3.128,want to be in a relationship?
"00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:35,326",0.917,"With me, I mean."
"00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:43,460",4.255,"If that's too much pressure, we could just date casually."
"00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:57,640",3.795,"You're not messing with me, are you?"
"00:47:00,977 --> 00:47:03,605",2.628,Is this question that unexpected for you?
"00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:06,858",2.711,I thought you knew on some level.
"00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,528",0.876,Well…
"00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:14,199",1.252,You didn't know?
"00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,368",1.584,But I've been smiling like this.
"00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,621",1.585,I've always been smiling.
"00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:26,795",2.169,"Gosh, I'm sorry."
"00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:31,049",3.128,I'm really sorry. I…
"00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:32,801",0.960,So that's why…
"00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,178",1.418,Well…
"00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,513",1.252,You had no idea.
"00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,183",1.960,Sorry to fluster you like this.
"00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,267",1.001,I mean…
"00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,395",1.167,It's okay.
"00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:48,024",3.545,"I thought you'd probably say no, but I just wanted to ask."
"00:47:48,983 --> 00:47:50,777",1.794,"It's fine, really."
"00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,364",2.294,Take care then. Bye.
"00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,513",1.043,That's the signal.

"00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:13,264",1.460,"He's coming. Hey, he's coming."
"00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,433",1.085,He's coming. Hurry…
"00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,144",1.084,Are you all right?
"00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:22,982",0.834,I'm okay.
"00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:25,818",1.543,Where…
"00:50:25,902 --> 00:50:28,404",2.502,Are you okay? Let me see. Is it your wrist?
"00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:29,822",1.334,Are you… Let me see.
"00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:36,204",0.960,Gi-jeong!
"00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,121",0.834,"Hey, you idiot."
"00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:57,809",1.335,It hurts.
"00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,064",1.543,It hurts.
"00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:05,316",2.169,"No, don't touch me. It hurts."
"00:51:16,661 --> 00:51:18,830",2.169,"I said, don't!"
"00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,414",1.501,Where did you fall?
"00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:22,834",2.336,On the street! Where else?
"00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:26,462",1.418,It hurts.
"00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,798",1.418,Why are you crying?
"00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:32,051",2.544,Because it hurts!
"00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,095",1.460,Goodness.
"00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,930",1.752,My God.
"00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:12,884",1.377,Damn it.
"00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:15,928",0.959,Gosh.
"00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:15,905",1.752,Is there fried shrimp too?

"00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:24,705",2.252,I'm making a fire to cook more food.
"00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:28,918",1.085,-It's raining. -Damn.
"00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:29,961",0.960,Shoot.
"00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,505",1.585,"-Jeez. -Come on, hurry."
"00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:33,839",1.251,What the hell?

"00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:38,177",0.959,"Yes, cover it."
"00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:40,596",2.335,It's just a shower. It'll stop soon.
"00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:44,809",2.628,"-Cover it. Hey, it's pouring. -Come on now."
"00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,894",2.002,It's pouring down.
"00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:48,980",1.043,Damn.
"00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,231",1.168,It's out of the blue.
"00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,608",1.626,Gosh.
"00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,155",2.085,How's Gi-jeong? Is her injury bad?
"00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,702",2.503,"Well, she didn't break her bone. It's just a crack."
"00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:03,869",1.084,Which hand?
"00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:05,997",0.835,Her left hand.
"00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:08,958",1.210,That's a relief.
"00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,377",1.543,You guys should've rehearsed it.
"00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,088",2.628,"Hey, I just gave her a little push."
"00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,924",2.753,How could I have known her bag strap would get caught?
"00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:20,303",3.295,"I thought, ""Chang-hee must really love her."""
"00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:22,722",2.336,"""He's determined to make her pass out."""
"00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:26,058",3.253,Gi-jeong has always been super dramatic.
"00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:27,393",1.251,Ever since she was little.
"00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,313",2.837,When we got into a fight and I hit her even just a little…
"00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,356",1.418,She acted like she was dying.
"00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,525",2.085,That's why I wasn't worried about her acting.
"00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,029",3.421,"She said if I give her a little push, she'd fall on her own."
"00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:39,280",1.168,I thought she would.
"00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:45,036",3.921,"Amnesia, my ass. If you're embarrassed, just be embarrassed."
"00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,955",2.836,Life is a series of embarrassments anyway.
"00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,291",2.252,It's embarrassing from the moment you're born.
"00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,584",1.210,You're born naked.
"00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:54,795",0.834,You're right.
"00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,173",0.834,It stopped.
"00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,425",2.169,"-Already? -Yes, it won't rain anymore."
"00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:03,763",0.835,Where's Mi-jeong?
"00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:07,600",2.544,She's out with her boyfriend. I wanted to see his face.
"00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:09,143",0.959,He's handsome.
"00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:11,520",1.626,That's not what I meant.
"00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:13,981",1.877,"She doesn't even know his name, right?"
"00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,650",1.876,I know men pretty well.
"00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:20,112",3.378,"Once I see him, I'll know what kind of life he's had since childhood."
"00:55:21,614 --> 00:55:22,615",1.001,That's scary.
"00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,619",3.212,How many men do you have to date to reach that level?
"00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:29,872",2.085,All men are the same breed.
"00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:33,542",3.587,You have a relationship with one and you know all there is to know.
"00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:36,128",2.502,"-We're all the same breed? -Turns out, yes."
"00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,215",0.918,Hey.
"00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,592",1.585,He and I are the same breed?
"00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:44,512",1.585,You're all the same breed.
"00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,556",2.961,"I know you want to believe that you're not, but you are."
"00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,643",3.003,"Sense of inferiority and superiority, self-love, and self-hatred."
"00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:53,437",2.711,"You all have these things, it's just the percentage that differs."
"00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,355",0.834,You all have them.
"00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,857",2.419,Every guy I've ever dated had them.
"00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,156",0.917,Here comes Gi-jeong.
"00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:09,453",2.461,"Gosh, I admire you."
"00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:11,872",2.335,"I mean, you're so cool."
"00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,400",1.210,What are you doing here?
"00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:44,321",2.669,"I came to see Mi-jeong's boyfriend, but they ran off."
"00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,116",1.418,You're not here to see me?
"00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,454",1.210,That too.
"00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,962",2.961,I'm sorry that I'm doing better than you expected.
"00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,089",2.044,"Well, let's just say that you're fine."
"00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:04,759",2.586,Getting rejected by a guy and getting a cast isn't so bad.
"00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,891",3.212,What happened? You said you'd pass out and pretend not to remember.
"00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:16,812",2.961,"Jeez, not anyone can act."
"00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,607",2.711,"I was sitting on the ground, so how could I pass out, you jerk?"
"00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,153",2.002,It turned out I still have my quick reflexes.
"00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:26,030",1.251,"At that moment,"
"00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,741",2.628,"I thought I might get hurt, so I planted my hand down."
"00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,534",1.710,My hand moved before I realized it.
"00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,538",2.127,Why do I have such good reflexes? Damn it.
"00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:43,088",4.337,"It was a perfect landing, so how could I pass out, you idiot?"
"00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,717",1.585,Jeez!
"00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:50,012",2.419,I'm an idiot for going there in the first place.
"00:57:52,932 --> 00:57:55,267",2.335,I don't think there's anything I can't do now.
"00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,978",2.127,I'm still growing even at this age.
"00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,692",3.712,I'm conquering yet another fear this way.
"00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:05,820",1.127,It's no big deal.
"00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:11,534",1.710,I can get over this!
"00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:12,868",1.251,You can get over this!
"00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,581",2.586,"It's all your fault, you fool."
"00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,586",2.586,Come on! Help me with this!
"00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,629",0.959,-The fire! -The fire.
"00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,131",1.209,Come on.
"00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:27,341",1.126,Do I have to help?
"00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:28,384",0.960,Come!
"00:58:41,397 --> 00:58:44,984",3.587,I'm relieved that you seem better than I thought.
"00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,203",1.835,"For a while, I couldn't sleep"
"00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:58,998",1.502,and had a lot on my mind.
"00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,502",2.502,"That's over, and I feel relieved now."
"00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:09,216",1.043,I feel better.
"00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,427",1.335,I should've done this sooner.
"00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,438",1.043,It's a rainbow.
"00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,568",1.418,It's a rainbow!
"00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:53,177",3.545,"WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT DESPITE YOUR POTENTIAL,"
"00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,388",3.128,WE CAN NOT OFFER YOU A POSITION ON THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM
"00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:03,020",3.337,"Yeom Chang-hee, let's get promoted!"
"01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,614",1.835,"Hey, Yu-rim! Cho Yu-rim!"
"01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:31,382",3.838,<i>Why do I want to take a picture again?</i>
"01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,007",1.794,"Sometimes, I have this thought."
"01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,301",1.334,"When you were three,"
"01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,512",1.460,"seven,"
"01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,515",1.668,and 19 years old…
"01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,310",2.711,I wish I could go back in time
"01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,148",2.378,and sit quietly next to your younger self.
"01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,365",1.334,You're doing that now.
"01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,248",1.543,"When I'm 90 years old,"
"01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,046",1.502,this will be my younger self.
"01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:47,154",3.299,MY LIBERATION NOTES
"01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,394",1.960,Why are you coming from Gu's house?
"01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:50,813",1.335,We're dating.
"01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,564",1.668,Who says something like that while eating?
"01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,692",1.960,<i>But you seem better than I thought.</i>
"01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:56,652",0.876,<i>You're amazing.</i>
"01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:01,198",3.754,<i>I've looked back on it. I'll be waiting to hear from you.</i>
"01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,700",2.419,<i>I will make her change no matter what.</i>
"01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,077",1.293,I'll give my all.
"01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,537",1.377,Why are you following me around?
"01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,205",1.585,"Hey, stop! Pull over."
"01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:12,417",2.210,<i>It's really you. What are you doing here?</i>
"01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:13,460",0.959,But someone died.
"01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,214",1.543,<i>I think he got wind of it.</i>
