MY LIBERATION NOTES

00:00:06,942 --> 00:00:11,856
MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,928
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:15,703
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:48,322
Stop messing around with your hair.

6
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:52,618
Before Tae-hun shaves his head
and goes to live in a temple.

7
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,787
If I had a crazy sister,

8
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:59,583
a daughter who doesn't listen to him,
and a hysterical girlfriend…

9
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:06,506
Is there anything I can do as I please
apart from my hair?

10
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:12,262
You are quite bold.

11
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:14,223
Cutting your own hair at home.

12
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,516
I did go to a salon to fix it a little.

13
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,812
Still, what if you'd ruined it?
You said you cut it with kitchen scissors.

14
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:22,648
I just

15
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,359
wanted to try cutting it
with my own hands.

16
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,528
Are you feeling better?

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,414
SURROUND AIR MASSAGER

18
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:42,668
<i>I'm thinking of getting this
for your father's birthday present.</i>

19
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,759
<i>No. You already gave him gifts
on </i>Chuseok<i> and New Year's.</i>

20
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:53,303
<i>You don't need to get
something for his birthday, too…</i>

21
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:56,014
<i>Just skip my dad's birthday. Please.</i>

22
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,311
<i>All right.</i>

23
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>Thank you.</i>

24
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,361
<i>Have a safe trip home.</i>

25
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,196
<i>And enjoy your lunch.</i>

26
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:14,866
<i>You, too. Enjoy your lunch.</i>

27
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,295
I'll have kimchi stew.

28
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,338
All right.

29
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,258
Me? I'll have kimchi <i>deopbap.</i>

30
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:32,217
Me too.

31
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,761
What's this?

32
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,266
I don't look good in anything
since my hair's shorter.

33
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:40,308
I know, right?

34
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,813
Oh, hello.

35
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:47,149
Hi.

36
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:51,236
What? Tae-hun?

37
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:53,655
-Hello.
-Hello.

38
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:55,782
Hello.

39
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,330
Your hair…

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,501
I cut it.

41
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:09,755
I see.

42
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:19,473
I guess we're enjoying lunch
at the same place today.

43
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,601
Yes.

44
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,938
Please, it's getting cold.

45
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,565
All right, enjoy your meal.

46
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,948
She's changed her style a lot, suddenly.

47
00:03:38,617 --> 00:03:39,451
Yes.

48
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,957
Did you not tell him you cut your hair?

49
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,175
It's like a war
whenever I go through Gangnam.

50
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,011
It's not like that
when you go north, right?

51
00:03:58,095 --> 00:03:59,596
I'm going to Gangnam, too, today.

52
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,556
I have plans with my former colleagues.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,185
You must have gotten along with them
at your previous workplace.

54
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:43,557
Mi-jeong…

55
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,475
Hello.

56
00:04:46,059 --> 00:04:47,352
It's been a while.

57
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:48,562
It's been ages.

58
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,522
Not for you two though, right?

59
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:53,191
Are you still dating Mi-jeong's sister?

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,610
Yes, of course.

61
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,071
Mi-jeong, you just keep getting--

62
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:02,576
I forgot we shouldn't talk
about stuff like this.

63
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,743
I forgot.

64
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:06,204
You should still finish
what you were saying.

65
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:07,372
"Getting" what?

66
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:09,666
Getting…

67
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,211
Happy New Year.

68
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,631
-Let's go inside.
-Yes.

69
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,091
-Let's go.
-Let's go in.

70
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,636
A while ago, I told my publisher friend

71
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,181
about the Liberation Club
at my school reunion.

72
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,433
And he asked me if he could see

73
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,560
what we wrote.

74
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,898
The liberation notes of all four of us.

75
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,275
He wants to publish them.

76
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:39,613
Publish them?

77
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:41,990
He said how we came together
would make a great story.

78
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,075
He said it's going to be something.

79
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,494
I have no idea what that something is,

80
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,122
but he was talking to me
with his eyes all sparkling.

81
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,707
It made me excited.

82
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,960
He says it could be a slice-of-life story

83
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,879
about ordinary office workers.

84
00:05:56,504 --> 00:05:58,256
Apparently, it's a great subject.

85
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,716
"Liberation."

86
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,470
I told him we didn't do it anymore,

87
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,389
but he keeps asking me to show him.

88
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:09,309
But it's not my decision
to make on my own.

89
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,646
So, I told him
I would ask you all in person.

90
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,483
Even today, he wanted to
come here with me so I had to stop him.

91
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:21,488
Are we going to be authors, then?

92
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,950
I don't think I can do that.

93
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,035
Why? Is it too much?

94
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:29,704
I haven't even written that much,

95
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,707
and it's too personal…

96
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:38,713
What if we use fake names?
Like pseudonyms.

97
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,968
Let's make pseudonyms.

98
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,265
I've also stopped halfway.

99
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:51,768
Wouldn't it still be quite a lot
if we gathered all of ours?

100
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,064
I've filled about two notebooks.

101
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:58,441
I kept writing
even after we stopped the club.

102
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,151
That's impressive.

103
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:03,530
What about you, Mi-jeong?
Do you still write?

104
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,492
No, I was done
after I had finished one notebook.

105
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:13,498
It sounds like
you've accomplished something.

106
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:14,666
It's not that.

107
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,962
But I'm not sure if it's good enough
to be published as a book--

108
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,173
He says it is!
Just the story from the four of us is…

109
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,344
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,265
I shouldn't have told him
without asking you guys first.

111
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,767
I shouldn't act like this at my age.

112
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,729
I told him about all of you,

113
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,398
and about the things
you wanted to be liberated from.

114
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:42,193
He liked it. He said it has weight.

115
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,248
<i>When we were saying goodbye,</i>

116
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:59,919
we were determined to see it through
to the end wherever we are.

117
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,633
I guess I was
just caught up in the moment.

118
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:08,970
I don't even know
where my notebook is now.

119
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:13,600
I was moved by the word "liberation,"

120
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:18,897
and I was moved again when you
mentioned your father's handwriting.

121
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,318
I was moved by all those moments,

122
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:29,366
then I went back
to living the way I used to.

123
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,996
But at the beginning, I thought,

124
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:39,250
"This must have been what it's like
to fight for Korea's liberation."

125
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:43,630
The feeling of holding something
in your heart.

126
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,426
My liberation.

127
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,013
But…

128
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,100
even though we did make a start,

129
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,436
we didn't accomplish anything, did we?

130
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,565
But…

131
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:06,528
we can't exactly say we
accomplished nothing, don't you think?

132
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,365
Do you feel a little liberated?

133
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:15,036
Well, some days, I feel like I am.

134
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,081
And some days, I feel like
I'm back to square one.

135
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:21,710
But I still feel
I've been liberated even just a little.

136
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,089
Do you not feel like that at all, Mr. Cho?

137
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,849
I found out why I was suffering,

138
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:38,351
but other than that…

139
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,361
I think that's what this is all about.

140
00:09:51,698 --> 00:09:53,658
Finding out what my issue is.

141
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:32,780
Let's end it with Hyeon.

142
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:35,992
Sir?

143
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:39,412
I'm sure he's pocketed
a lot of money all this time.

144
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:43,541
Make it look like we're closing the place
because business isn't good

145
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,044
and move the shop somewhere else.

146
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,583
I have a good feeling.

147
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,585
See? It's a flush.

148
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,423
A flush? I knew it.

149
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,390
-I feel bad for you.
-Damn it.

150
00:11:58,783 --> 00:12:00,243
You kept telling me to come back

151
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,370
when I was living quietly
in the countryside.

152
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,539
It was because you needed money to gamble.

153
00:12:11,337 --> 00:12:12,630
Can't you stop?

154
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:14,424
Can't you?

155
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,885
-Can't you just stop?
-You're one to talk!

156
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,470
Can you stop?

157
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:22,098
You drink from sunrise to sunset.

158
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:25,476
You can't even remember your own number.
Who are you to tell me that?

159
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,814
Mind your own business!

160
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:50,168
If the daily revenue goes below 80 million
even once starting tomorrow, you're out.

161
00:12:55,923 --> 00:12:56,841
Understood?

162
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:05,266
You're out if it drops
below that even once.

163
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:18,112
And why do I have to remember my number?

164
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,426
Aren't you going to answer?

165
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:42,887
Sir?

166
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,056
Your phone's ringing.

167
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,063
Isn't this your phone?

168
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,649
What ringing, sir?

169
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:33,396
We'll be off.

170
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,605
Good night.

171
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,702
Well, I'm taking the bus.

172
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,037
I see.

173
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,042
-All right, then. Happy New…
-Yes. Happy New Year, sir.

174
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,757
Get home safe.

175
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:28,910
I could never forget
what you said that day, Mi-jeong.

176
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:33,122
You once said to me

177
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,958
that when you decided to be liberated,

178
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,338
you started feeling emotions
that you'd never felt before.

179
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:47,220
You said you suddenly felt so lovable.

180
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:55,895
I wonder what it's like

181
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:58,731
to feel lovable.

182
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,534
See you again.

183
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,576
Take care.

184
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:29,637
My gosh.

185
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:33,891
So you can joke around, too.

186
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,395
I thought my hands would get shaky first,

187
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,690
but I'm hearing things instead.

188
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,944
Well, my brain must be breaking down.

189
00:17:17,196 --> 00:17:20,825
I deserve it. Since I drink as soon as
I open my eyes in the morning.

190
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,996
Not a lot of people
start drinking in the morning.

191
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,999
They say even heavy drinkers
can't drink in the morning.

192
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,670
But it's easier than being sober.

193
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,758
Why is it hard to stay sober?

194
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:45,182
When I'm sober,

195
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:50,688
all the people from my past come to me.

196
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:53,399
All of them.

197
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:56,569
Even the dead.

198
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,784
When I wake up in the morning,

199
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:07,163
the ones who were resting…

200
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,042
get up one by one

201
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:13,377
and come to me.

202
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,671
One by one.

203
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:18,007
Endlessly…

204
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,677
The ones who come for me…

205
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:24,555
I destroy them all inside my head.

206
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,766
And curse at them.

207
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,353
After I sit there

208
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:32,813
for an hour doing that,

209
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,192
I get exhausted.

210
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:40,279
It feels like…

211
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:44,575
there's sewage waste
flowing inside my body.

212
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:49,705
I say, "Let's get up."

213
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:51,832
"Let's drink."

214
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,087
"They'll all go away if I drink."

215
00:18:59,256 --> 00:19:00,466
That's why

216
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,302
I'm more generous drunk

217
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:07,014
than I am when sober.

218
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:15,356
Among those people who came for you,

219
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,900
was I one of them?

220
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,211
What's wrong with me?

221
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:43,384
I'm not even an alcoholic,
but I understand you perfectly.

222
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:50,015
When I'm brushing my teeth in the morning
after a good sleep,

223
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:53,853
Choi Jun-ho, that asshole,
is waiting for me in my head.

224
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:57,356
Han Su-jin, that bitch, is there too.

225
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,484
And that bastard, Jung Chan-hyeok, too.

226
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,989
All I did was sleep and wake up.

227
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:09,493
But I get angry while brushing my teeth.

228
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:15,624
What's that bastard's phone number?

229
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,628
Just give me the number.
I'll take care of it.

230
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,176
That bastard…

231
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,596
shouldn't pay me back.

232
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:33,684
Because I want to prove
what a terrible person he is

233
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,562
for as long as possible.

234
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,190
I want to prove to the world

235
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:44,528
that he didn't leave me
because I was small and insignificant,

236
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:46,489
but because he was a terrible person.

237
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,241
That's why he left me like that.

238
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,328
I wanted to make him think

239
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,040
that he was
a terrible person during his wedding.

240
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,627
And if he ever has a child,
I want to go to their birthday party

241
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:04,798
and remind him again
that he's a terrible person.

242
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,976
That's why

243
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,647
I'm always exhausted.

244
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:27,530
Since I decided
to be someone who exists only to prove…

245
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:33,702
how terrible someone is.

246
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,670
Among those people
you wanted to prove were terrible…

247
00:21:47,132 --> 00:21:48,342
was I one of them?

248
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,767
You're like…

249
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,023
a sanctuary that I keep within my head.

250
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:06,485
Because I decided
to keep you away from my hate.

251
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,031
After you left,

252
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,034
my mom passed away,

253
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,203
and my dad remarried…

254
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:19,873
I felt like

255
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,252
I was constantly being abandoned.

256
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:29,383
In every kind of relationship I've had,
I've never walked away first.

257
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:31,260
The other person always left me.

258
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:36,056
So I thought maybe
something was wrong with me.

259
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,852
And since it was so painful
to find a problem with myself,

260
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,771
I made myself believe
everyone else was the asshole.

261
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:46,317
But I was

262
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,445
determined from the moment I met you.

263
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,658
that I wouldn't make
any more assholes in my life.

264
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,039
That I'd gladly let you fly away
if you become a better person.

265
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:03,709
That I wouldn't be embarrassed
even if you hit rock bottom.

266
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:07,963
That I'd only cheer you on
from one person to another.

267
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:12,843
When I felt like I would hate you,
I begged in my head,

268
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:16,263
"Please, don't even let him catch a cold."

269
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:21,602
"Please don't let him suffer
from a hangover."

270
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,983
But since I was unhappy all the time,

271
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,904
when I wanted to blame you out of anger,

272
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,156
I would say,
"Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."

273
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,328
Whenever nothing was going my way

274
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,997
and I didn't know where to vent my anger,

275
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:45,876
I said, "Jung Chan-hyeok, you bastard."

276
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,340
Then it occurred to me,

277
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,343
"What if he pays it all back?"

278
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,721
"Who would I curse, then?"

279
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,894
I'm worried he might pay me back.

280
00:24:11,026 --> 00:24:12,236
Come to think of it…

281
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,200
I've never caught a cold.

282
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:47,020
Everyone, run backwards
and wave your arms and say, "Welcome!"

283
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,189
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

284
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,318
Face front again!

285
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:58,615
See you later!

286
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,535
Hurry it up, okay?

287
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:05,330
We've got all kinds of pork.
It's an all-you-can-eat pork buffet!

288
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:27,102
It sure is different.

289
00:25:27,853 --> 00:25:31,190
Mi-jeong went to the store early
in the morning to get freshly made ones.

290
00:25:31,273 --> 00:25:32,691
Yes, you can tell.

291
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,652
Do you like the matching shirts?

292
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,367
That kimchi isn't good. Don't eat it.

293
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:44,703
There's amazing kimchi in the fridge.

294
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,502
Why did you get your hair cut

295
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:54,254
in the middle of winter?

296
00:25:57,382 --> 00:25:59,426
I had it cut since it was
too hard to wash it.

297
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,512
It feels so light now that it's short.

298
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:02,763
Goodness me.

299
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:12,981
This is medication for your knee, Dad.

300
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,816
Take two tablets in the morning.

301
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,616
You've done well.

302
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:25,827
How did you pay back all of it?

303
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:28,455
You're amazing.

304
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,040
It's nothing.

305
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,550
I can treat you all to beef sashimi
and everything, now.

306
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:43,595
If I make 2.8 million won now,
it's all mine.

307
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,681
I reduced the amount of money I spend,

308
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,391
so I don't really spend much.

309
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,477
I can eat whatever I want

310
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:51,937
and still have some money left.

311
00:26:52,771 --> 00:26:55,357
I never realized
2.8 million won was so much.

312
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,359
Just like eating an almond

313
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,070
after being on a strict diet

314
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,739
and thinking, "Wow, an almond
could taste this good?"

315
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:04,866
Is it something like that?

316
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:09,079
Seriously, I was worried
she might divorce my dad.

317
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:12,708
So, I just sucked it up
and paid it all back.

318
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,461
What would would have
my stepmother thought

319
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,880
if she saw that his children
had trouble with money?

320
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:21,174
She might regret marrying him.

321
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:26,096
She probably felt very secure
that my dad owned some land.

322
00:27:26,597 --> 00:27:30,726
If my dad gets divorced,
I'll have to bring him to live with us.

323
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:34,229
You know,

324
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:36,648
when my mom passed away

325
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:40,652
and I was having all three meals
with just my dad,

326
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:43,280
I kept worrying that we might
grow old together like this

327
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:44,990
if I don't do anything.

328
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:46,658
It was depressing.

329
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,497
So I thought, "I need to get it together
and help my dad remarry."

330
00:27:53,123 --> 00:27:55,792
As soon as
someone set him up with a woman,

331
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,628
I got him an exfoliation treatment

332
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,254
and a facelift.

333
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:04,051
I just can't believe Mr. Yeom even went
to the dermatology clinic with you.

334
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:04,968
Right.

335
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:06,970
He had to if he didn't want to
live with me forever.

336
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:11,725
And why would I ruin his marriage
that we put so much effort into?

337
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:16,188
So, I just had to suck it up
and put my all into paying it back.

338
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:21,151
Saving money may be hard,
but spending it was so easy.

339
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,903
The money I saved over ten years…

340
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:26,823
That's why you don't save any.
Just spend it all.

341
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,243
I really thought I hit the jackpot.

342
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:35,248
I was going to sell sweet potato ovens
to over 2,000 convenience stores.

343
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,334
And looking at the warehouse
full of ovens,

344
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:43,548
I thought I had finally
made a breakthrough in life.

345
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:48,345
But to have given all of that up…

346
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:52,516
I'm amazing.

347
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,477
I gave up selling them to stores

348
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,479
and only sold 300 of them that winter.

349
00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:00,857
The other 1700 are still
sitting in the warehouse.

350
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,651
The story keeps changing.

351
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,486
You said you failed

352
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:07,030
since you couldn't
go to the machine testing.

353
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,782
I could but I didn't.

354
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:11,034
They were all loaded in a truck.

355
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:15,163
And the test was just a formality.
They were the number one bid.

356
00:29:15,247 --> 00:29:19,251
Then why didn't you go?
It was all yours for the taking.

357
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:23,463
What?

358
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:25,507
What?

359
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,596
This is so unlike you.

360
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,974
Are you teasing me?
Why aren't you saying anything?

361
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,394
You know

362
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,439
how I always vent by talking?

363
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:44,067
But I don't want to this time.

364
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:48,238
This silence of mine.

365
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:50,240
The stoic and cool me
that only I remember.

366
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,869
Jeez…

367
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:56,663
I won't do it because if I do,

368
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:59,332
the weight of my silence
will be lightened.

369
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:04,629
It'll be my own secret, forever.

370
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:05,839
You little…

371
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:07,924
Don't worry, alright?

372
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,634
He'll tell us in a minute.

373
00:30:31,073 --> 00:30:34,076
What's with you? The minute's almost up.

374
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:41,583
You know what?

375
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:45,253
-He'll tell us if we tickle him.
-That's right.

376
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:46,880
-Tell us.
-He'll tell us.

377
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:56,056
The words sit on the tip of your tongue,
wanting to come out.

378
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,851
But when you swallow them back down,

379
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:03,688
that's when you know you're an adult.

380
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:08,443
You fall in love with yourself thinking,
"I can't believe I held back."

381
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,241
I'm falling in love with myself again.

382
00:31:15,492 --> 00:31:16,785
This bastard…

383
00:31:18,495 --> 00:31:21,456
Why did he get so annoying?

384
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,129
It's amazing.

385
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,811
I didn't feel good
for even a second today.

386
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:47,023
But right at the end, I do.

387
00:31:50,235 --> 00:31:51,528
I'm going to walk.

388
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,156
Please get in, sir. You'll catch a cold.

389
00:31:56,366 --> 00:31:57,534
I won't.

390
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:14,718
YEAR 2008
YEOM MI-JEONG

391
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,471
YEOM MI-JEONG

392
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,943
MY FRIEND EUN-O WON TODAY
I FELL IN LOVE WITH EUN-O'S PASSION.

393
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:33,361
BUT I CAN'T STAND SONG JI-SEON.

394
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,705
MY LIBERATION NOTES
YEOM MI-JEONG

395
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:46,625
MY LIBERATION NOTES

396
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:07,896
When I sit here

397
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:12,317
with your father and watch the snow,

398
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:17,072
I think, "I never thought
this kind of day would come."

399
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:50,397
RECENT DESTINATION

400
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,066
Has Yeom Gi-jeong decided
not to come anymore?

401
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:57,404
She doesn't come
to the bar anymore, either.

402
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:58,446
Did you break up?

403
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:02,867
She's in Sanpo.
It's her father's birthday.

404
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:10,458
I wonder what kind of excuse
she'll have next week.

405
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,681
Hello?

406
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:28,852
If I have to,

407
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,981
I'll take her and disappear,
so don't worry.

408
00:34:45,577 --> 00:34:47,120
There's egg bread!

409
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,457
-Are we not buying any?
-He said Gi-jeong's not here!

410
00:34:57,005 --> 00:34:58,298
Help yourself.

411
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,050
Okay.

412
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:04,220
I wonder if I'll ever see
Mi-jeong gossiping before I die.

413
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:07,724
I talk a lot.

414
00:35:08,516 --> 00:35:09,351
With whom?

415
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:15,148
No. I forgot the <i>dongchimi.</i>

416
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:17,233
It's okay. There's a lot to eat here.

417
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,194
We've got amazing <i>dongchimi.</i>

418
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:21,863
Take some with you.
I'll pack them for you.

419
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:22,947
All right.

420
00:35:35,085 --> 00:35:37,879
If you think you would be fine
living on your own,

421
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,048
just do that.

422
00:35:41,674 --> 00:35:43,885
It's okay for you to do that.

423
00:35:47,972 --> 00:35:50,809
I don't think someone who's
gotten married twice can say that.

424
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:57,399
I can because I've done it twice.

425
00:36:04,197 --> 00:36:05,156
Your dad

426
00:36:06,866 --> 00:36:08,076
isn't strong.

427
00:36:10,745 --> 00:36:11,871
You guys

428
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:14,124
are better than me.

429
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:53,997
There's a film called <i>Return To Paradise</i>.

430
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:57,083
I saw it when I was in high school.

431
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,753
It's a story about three men backpacking.

432
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:05,550
They hang out for a few days together
and then part ways.

433
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:08,678
Two of them decide
to go back to their country,

434
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:10,722
and one of them decides to stay.

435
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:16,019
But after a few years,
some lawyer comes to talk to them.

436
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:20,148
The three of them smoked marijuana
when they were together,

437
00:37:21,149 --> 00:37:24,736
but the one who stayed
got caught for possession.

438
00:37:26,738 --> 00:37:31,117
But the marijuana he had was enough
for him to receive the death penalty.

439
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,748
The lawyer tells the two of them that
if they testify they were in it together,

440
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,667
he could avoid the death penalty
since the punishment will be

441
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:41,336
reduced by one-third.

442
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:43,296
But…

443
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:48,760
all three of them would have to
be in prison for three years.

444
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:51,471
I wouldn't go.

445
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:58,770
The one who was
pretending to be conscientious

446
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:01,314
and said they should help him
avoid the death penalty

447
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:04,234
runs away after seeing
how bad the prison is in that country.

448
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:06,569
But…

449
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:09,489
the one who said he didn't want to go,

450
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:14,118
he begins to change his mind
after seeing what it's like there.

451
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:17,288
He thinks, "Shouldn't we stay with him?"

452
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,794
In the end, the one who pretended
to be conscientious runs away,

453
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,298
and the man who was arrested
is sentenced to death.

454
00:38:27,882 --> 00:38:30,802
And the one who changed his mind
testifies on his friend's behalf

455
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:32,387
and becomes imprisoned.

456
00:38:34,305 --> 00:38:35,890
It's ridiculous, right?

457
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,017
But…

458
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:40,562
on the day of the execution,

459
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:45,525
when the man who was sentenced
to death is trembling on the scaffold,

460
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:51,197
the one who testified for him
shouts from inside his cell,

461
00:38:53,658 --> 00:38:55,285
"I'm here!"

462
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:57,662
"Look into my eyes."

463
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:59,914
"I'm right here!"

464
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:03,126
"I'm right here!"

465
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,049
For those ten minutes…

466
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:12,677
Or maybe it was five.

467
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:17,432
I felt I could be
in that prison for three years

468
00:39:18,808 --> 00:39:21,394
just to be able to experience
those five minutes.

469
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,691
Though they weren't even close friends.

470
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:34,365
You bastard.

471
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:37,994
You watched an R-rated movie
when you were in high school…

472
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,166
I'm on my way.

473
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,296
They told me to hurry so we can go home.

474
00:39:49,922 --> 00:39:51,341
When are you coming again?

475
00:39:56,137 --> 00:39:58,806
FAR-INFRARED SWEET POTATO OVEN
TASTY SWEET POTATOES

476
00:40:02,894 --> 00:40:03,728
Yes…

477
00:40:05,063 --> 00:40:07,023
You know the test is at our store, right?

478
00:40:07,106 --> 00:40:09,025
I know. I'm leaving now.

479
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:11,736
Why are you leaving so early?
It's only 11.

480
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:15,198
I need to go set things up in advance.
I also need to stop by somewhere.

481
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:17,116
I'll see you there.

482
00:40:40,014 --> 00:40:40,890
Hyeok-su.

483
00:40:55,154 --> 00:40:58,324
Sir. Can you hear me?

484
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:00,368
His vitals are dropping…

485
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:02,787
CALLING
JI HYEON-A

486
00:41:05,123 --> 00:41:08,292
<i>Hyeok-su doesn't have much time left.
Hurry here, quickly.</i>

487
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,715
We can't reach his guardian.
At this rate, it's a matter of hours.

488
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,925
Do you have any other numbers?

489
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,218
We don't.

490
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:20,221
Give me his mother's number.
I'll try calling her.

491
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:31,107
INCOMING CALL
LEE MIN-GYU

492
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:36,028
Yes.

493
00:41:36,779 --> 00:41:40,700
Why aren't you here yet?
The people from HQ are here.

494
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,787
I need to hang up for now.

495
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,540
I got it. I'll call you back.

496
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,503
CALL
JI HYEON-A

497
00:41:52,587 --> 00:41:53,588
JI HYEON-A

498
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:43,304
Hyeok-su.

499
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:45,556
I'm sorry

500
00:42:46,682 --> 00:42:48,267
for making you feel anxious.

501
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:52,146
Hyeok-su.

502
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,817
It will be just the two of us.

503
00:42:56,692 --> 00:42:57,902
I'll be here for you.

504
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:00,446
I think…

505
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:03,950
I was destined for things like this.

506
00:43:06,244 --> 00:43:09,372
I was also there when my grandpa,
grandma, and my mother

507
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:10,915
passed away.

508
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:13,543
Isn't it weird?

509
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:17,922
Most people my age
haven't even witnessed one death.

510
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,509
But…

511
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:25,346
I think it's better that it's me.

512
00:43:26,597 --> 00:43:27,849
Whenever I send them away,

513
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:31,936
I was relieved that I was there.

514
00:43:36,274 --> 00:43:38,568
My legs led me here again, like a psychic.

515
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:43,531
Hyeok-su.

516
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,578
I know since I've sent three people away.

517
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:50,705
When you go…

518
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:55,585
you'll feel better.

519
00:43:58,462 --> 00:43:59,797
Their faces told me.

520
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:06,304
So Hyeok-su,

521
00:44:07,972 --> 00:44:09,265
don't be afraid…

522
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:14,020
and leave peacefully.

523
00:44:15,062 --> 00:44:16,063
Gently.

524
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:34,540
I'm right here.

525
00:44:58,147 --> 00:45:01,776
<i>The person you have called
is not available at the moment…</i>

526
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:24,465
FAR-INFRARED SWEET POTATO OVEN
TASTY SWEET POTATOES

527
00:45:28,302 --> 00:45:34,684
CAFE MONOLOGUE
OPENS FEBRUARY 18, 2022

528
00:45:56,414 --> 00:45:57,289
What did they say?

529
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,167
They said to come starting tomorrow.

530
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:07,383
Didn't you say
the one in Jamwon-dong pays well too?

531
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:11,637
I'll keep working there,
and this is just for the weekend.

532
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:15,433
I thought it'd be nice to work in Gangbuk.

533
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:18,853
Take it easy, no one's after you.

534
00:46:20,563 --> 00:46:25,943
I only feel alive
when I exhaust myself completely.

535
00:46:26,861 --> 00:46:30,406
If I have any energy left, I feel heavy.

536
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:34,827
"Nothing has gone my way,
and I haven't achieved anything,

537
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,538
but I've done my best at least."

538
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,460
Is it like the way you feel spent
after having diarrhea?

539
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,006
I wish I had diarrhea.

540
00:46:49,049 --> 00:46:50,217
Drink an iced latte.

541
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,927
Shall I buy you one?

542
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:54,680
I need to drink it at home, not outside.

543
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,813
You look better than I expected.

544
00:47:04,523 --> 00:47:06,400
Why wouldn't I?

545
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:13,199
The weather's nice.
Spring must be on its way.

546
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,534
It must be.

547
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:18,788
Spring will come, then summer,

548
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:20,831
and then winter.

549
00:47:26,629 --> 00:47:27,838
Bye, then.

550
00:47:27,922 --> 00:47:28,839
Bye.

551
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:34,345
I'll come to the convenience store
after work on the weekend.

552
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:51,821
I regretted it.

553
00:47:54,406 --> 00:47:55,699
That I said

554
00:47:56,867 --> 00:48:00,454
I wanted to escape
from feeling weak at the Liberation Club.

555
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:05,251
I feel like I meddled
with something unacceptable

556
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:07,795
that I was supposed
to pretend not to know about.

557
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:10,339
And because you, Gi-jeong,

558
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:14,677
were drawn to me after hearing those words
and felt sorry for me,

559
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:19,014
I realized you wouldn't be
able to leave me even if you wanted to.

560
00:48:19,598 --> 00:48:22,643
You're right, I can't leave you.
No, I won't leave you.

561
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,145
What's wrong with being
drawn to someone out of pity?

562
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,857
With human emotions,

563
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,069
you can't always distinguish
between pity, respect, and love clearly.

564
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:34,822
I can't. I've got them
all balled up in a lump.

565
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:37,908
I respect you, Tae-hun.

566
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:40,411
And I pity you and I love you.
I feel all of it.

567
00:48:44,582 --> 00:48:45,624
By the way,

568
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:49,044
why did you cut your hair?

569
00:48:49,753 --> 00:48:50,588
What?

570
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:52,923
Can't I cut my hair?

571
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:54,466
Aren't I allowed?

572
00:49:04,727 --> 00:49:07,021
I don't know how it got like this.

573
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:10,691
I wanted to be one to cheer you on.

574
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:12,735
That's what I wanted,

575
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:17,489
but it feels like I'm just another woman
who's making your life harder.

576
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,037
I mean, to be honest, I don't know
what the problem is.

577
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,122
"What did Tae-hun do that was so wrong?"

578
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:27,458
"And why do I feel so wronged?"

579
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,754
I mean, there's nothing particular
I can pick out as an example, it's just…

580
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:36,467
It's just this general feeling
that I'm losing at something.

581
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,178
I'm ashamed to be a woman
with so little self-esteem

582
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:41,138
who breaks down at the glare of a kid.

583
00:49:41,764 --> 00:49:44,516
I was used to how
Gyeong-seon treats people.

584
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,728
She's always been that way,
ever since high school.

585
00:49:47,811 --> 00:49:50,022
"But why are her words hurting me again?"

586
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:53,108
"Because I love Tae-hun?"

587
00:49:53,776 --> 00:49:56,528
"But why does that have to be a reason
for me to feel small?"

588
00:49:57,363 --> 00:50:00,199
"Love is supposed to give you strength,

589
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,705
but will I be happy if we broke up?"

590
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:11,293
But if I imagine breaking up,

591
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:14,338
my arm feels numb.

592
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:17,424
I get a kind of shock under my arm.

593
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:23,389
So, it's clear I can't break up with you,
which means I have to go further.

594
00:50:25,182 --> 00:50:27,351
But I don't know how to do that.

595
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,401
I didn't say this
because it felt like an excuse,

596
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:38,404
but I'll say it anyway.

597
00:50:41,281 --> 00:50:42,783
For some reason,

598
00:50:44,451 --> 00:50:47,871
when I see a kid toddling along
from behind,

599
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:52,084
I feel bad.

600
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:55,337
"In thirty years,

601
00:50:56,296 --> 00:50:58,632
what kind of burdens
will they be carrying around?"

602
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:03,262
"What kind of humiliation
will they have endured?"

603
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:07,349
"I was able to because it was me."

604
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:10,060
"But that kid…"

605
00:51:12,229 --> 00:51:15,858
I wish that no child would ever
have to endure those kinds of things.

606
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:19,611
And of course, I'm glad I have Yu-rim.

607
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,365
I can't even imagine my life
without Yu-rim.

608
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:26,785
"Was I happy to be born?"

609
00:51:29,413 --> 00:51:31,206
If I think about it seriously…

610
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:36,462
the answer is no.

611
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:43,719
I think that's why when you said
you weren't pregnant,

612
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:46,013
I let out

613
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:49,933
a sigh of relief involuntarily.

614
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:56,231
That was it

615
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:59,193
for Cho Tae-hun's excuse.

616
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:10,996
But…

617
00:52:12,956 --> 00:52:15,584
if we have to live because we were born,

618
00:52:16,627 --> 00:52:18,504
how are we supposed to live?

619
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:25,511
I'll be a man.

620
00:52:27,262 --> 00:52:29,181
Four women are too much for you, right?

621
00:52:29,264 --> 00:52:30,599
From today, I'm a man.

622
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,351
I'm a man.

623
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:35,187
That's why I cut my hair.

624
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:48,826
Go on ahead. I'll stop by the bank.

625
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:49,868
-Sure.
-Yes.

626
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,584
Yes, what about the chief?

627
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:01,713
Isn't he there?

628
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:05,884
I really need to discuss this with him.

629
00:53:07,386 --> 00:53:08,637
One moment.

630
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,223
Yes, sir.

631
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:12,683
<i>Take your card.</i>

632
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:15,060
Yes, I just got off the phone
with Mr. Lee.

633
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:18,230
Yes, he said the handover wasn't complete.

634
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:20,440
Oh, I see.

635
00:53:22,151 --> 00:53:23,360
Yes.

636
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:24,778
Yes, I understand.

637
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:38,250
He didn't. It was his bag.

638
00:54:16,872 --> 00:54:17,915
Do you

639
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:20,500
work around here?

640
00:54:22,294 --> 00:54:23,503
Yes, at H Card.

641
00:54:28,217 --> 00:54:30,177
It seems you work around here, too.

642
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:33,305
There, at MC Mall.

643
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,770
I'll send you a million won tomorrow.

644
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:44,316
Give me some more time for the rest.

645
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:51,782
I'm sorry for dragging it out so long.

646
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:55,786
It's fine.

647
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,163
I'll be off. It's my lunch break.

648
00:54:59,623 --> 00:55:00,791
Right.

649
00:55:00,874 --> 00:55:01,875
Sure, bye.

650
00:55:28,777 --> 00:55:29,903
Yeom Mi-jeong.

651
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:34,449
Yeom Mi-jeong!

652
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:58,307
-Where are you headed?
-To buy alcohol.

653
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:01,518
There's a convenience store this way too.

654
00:56:06,481 --> 00:56:10,027
I like it when you shout, "Yeom Mi-jeong!"

655
00:56:20,829 --> 00:56:24,416
When I went home, I read my old diaries,
and I was so surprised.

656
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:27,502
Because the childhood that I remember

657
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:30,130
and the one recorded in my diaries
were so different.

658
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:34,259
I thought I was a clueless kid
who didn't feel anything for anyone

659
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:37,012
and had no sense of presence.

660
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:40,057
But in the diaries, I've got so much love.

661
00:56:40,682 --> 00:56:44,102
"I like her because of this.
I like him because of that."

662
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:46,688
Turns out I was a really passionate kid.

663
00:56:47,814 --> 00:56:48,857
You didn't know?

664
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:51,109
You're passionate.

665
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:01,453
Why did you drink so much?

666
00:57:03,664 --> 00:57:04,831
Because I felt good.

667
00:57:13,924 --> 00:57:14,800
Sometimes…

668
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:17,928
very occasionally,

669
00:57:20,472 --> 00:57:23,308
it's quiet inside my head
even when I'm sober.

670
00:57:26,186 --> 00:57:27,646
As if…

671
00:57:29,648 --> 00:57:31,191
everything's stopped, I guess?

672
00:57:33,485 --> 00:57:36,071
Then I pour in the hard liquor again.

673
00:57:40,701 --> 00:57:42,494
When I feel comfortable and happy

674
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,456
I drink to break it
because I hate feeling that way.

675
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,877
When I feel my life
is going okay, I drink.

676
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:53,755
I beat myself up in advance.

677
00:57:55,507 --> 00:57:59,136
"I'm not happy."

678
00:58:01,555 --> 00:58:03,765
"I'm definitely not happy."

679
00:58:03,849 --> 00:58:05,183
"I've been miserable."

680
00:58:06,268 --> 00:58:09,896
"So please punish me just a little.
Please, only a little."

681
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:15,277
"Waking up and sitting up
in the morning is hard."

682
00:58:16,194 --> 00:58:19,656
"I felt like I couldn't even
take five steps back,

683
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,243
so I didn't go back for my umbrella
and walked in the rain."

684
00:58:25,662 --> 00:58:28,039
"Because those five steps
were too difficult,

685
00:58:28,582 --> 00:58:30,876
I got soaked in the rain."

686
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:37,591
"My life is too hard, I'm so tired."

687
00:58:38,175 --> 00:58:42,721
"I'm already being punished harshly.
So please, I'm begging you!"

688
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:53,190
Why are you so adorable?

689
00:59:06,745 --> 00:59:09,039
When those people come
to you again in the morning,

690
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:10,791
laugh like you did now.

691
00:59:14,544 --> 00:59:15,670
Welcome them like that.

692
00:59:31,144 --> 00:59:32,395
Yeom Mi-jeong!

693
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:49,621
Gi-jeong.

694
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,334
Gi-jeong.

695
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,548
Why did you buy more? I still have some.

696
01:00:05,466 --> 01:00:07,301
I just thought of it on my way.

697
01:00:08,052 --> 01:00:10,471
Wait. What's this?

698
01:00:10,554 --> 01:00:13,140
I felt a bit bad about always
just bringing you egg bread.

699
01:00:13,223 --> 01:00:14,350
Well, I'll be off.

700
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,226
Wait. What is it?

701
01:00:18,646 --> 01:00:20,230
I asked you what this is!

702
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:22,191
It's my heart.

703
01:00:23,108 --> 01:00:23,984
What?

704
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,484
<i>Pick-up girl, Yeom Gi-jeong.</i>

705
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,195
<i>I found the head of a rose
that broke off from its stem</i>

706
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:10,864
<i>and placed it in a soy sauce dish
filled with water.</i>

707
01:01:12,074 --> 01:01:14,618
<i>Even if I tried to make it stand,
it doesn't have a stem,</i>

708
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:16,495
<i>so I laid it in a soy sauce dish.</i>

709
01:01:18,706 --> 01:01:22,459
<i>Wouldn't it be wonderful
if our love was a long-stemmed rose</i>

710
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:24,336
<i>blooming beautifully in a vase?</i>

711
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:29,717
<i>This rose lying exhausted
in a soy sauce dish reminded me of you</i>

712
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:31,135
<i>and me.</i>

713
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:34,680
<i>I'm afraid it would wither faster
if I'm not looking</i>

714
01:01:34,763 --> 01:01:36,306
<i>so I can't take my eyes off of it.</i>

715
01:01:37,057 --> 01:01:39,351
<i>That's the type of woman I am.</i>

716
01:01:41,979 --> 01:01:43,897
<i>A man who buys me egg bread</i>

717
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:47,067
<i>once every three days
in the winter because I said I liked it.</i>

718
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:50,738
<i>What if I said I liked beef?</i>

719
01:01:52,698 --> 01:01:55,909
<i>I compliment myself
for saying I liked egg bread,</i>

720
01:01:57,286 --> 01:01:59,830
<i>and as for you,
who always buys me egg bread…</i>

721
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,125
<i>I love you.</i>

722
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:16,305
<i>Tae-hun, the buttons on your coat
are done up wrong.</i>

723
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:49,713
I'll be back later. Take care.

-Yes, it is.

-It's right here.
-It's here.

LECTURE ROOM 302

731
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,512
Hello, everyone.

732
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:39,805
-Hello.
-Hello.

733
01:03:39,888 --> 01:03:41,932
-The weather's quite cold, isn't it?
-It is.

734
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:45,102
All right. Let me just
take a quick look at you.

735
01:03:46,061 --> 01:03:46,895
All right.

736
01:03:50,399 --> 01:03:54,528
So, let's take some time
to get to know each other.

737
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:57,197
You at the front, when's your birthday?

738
01:03:57,281 --> 01:03:58,323
It's May 9th.

739
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:00,784
You were born on a good day.

740
01:04:00,868 --> 01:04:03,704
-And what about your birthday?
-Mine's September 19th.

741
01:04:03,787 --> 01:04:04,746
-September 19th?
-Yes.

742
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:06,874
You were born on an even better day.

743
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:09,209
And may I ask the day you'll die?

744
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:10,878
Yes, the day you'll die.

745
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:12,004
You don't know yet?

746
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:13,922
May I ask you when you're planning to die?

747
01:04:14,006 --> 01:04:15,340
I'm not sure.

748
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:17,676
-You don't really know, right? Me neither.
-No.

749
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:22,973
We all know when we were born,
but we have no idea when we'll die, right?

750
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:26,768
So, whether you're alive or dead,

751
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:29,605
you're never prepared
for your last journey.

752
01:04:30,189 --> 01:04:32,274
As those who've experienced it know,

753
01:04:32,357 --> 01:04:36,528
it's very sad when a precious person
in your life passes away.

754
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:40,616
And the person
who stays beside them to help them

755
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:42,409
leave comfortably and beautifully,

756
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:46,914
and to help the rest of their family
see them off in peace, is…

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

A funeral director,
which all of you will soon become.

Everyone, please take

762
01:05:04,806 --> 01:05:08,143
-You've heard of a wedding planner, right?
-Yes.

763
01:05:08,227 --> 01:05:10,979
Their job is to manage the entire wedding.

764
01:05:11,063 --> 01:05:15,609
You could say that funeral directors
do the same for funerals.

765
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:19,488
Like how a wedding is a ceremonial event
for a couple embarking on a new beginning,

766
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:26,203
a funeral is also a ceremonial event
to mark the end of a person's life.

767
01:05:26,995 --> 01:05:28,038
Welcome.

768
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:34,127
I'm glad to see everyone who's come here
to become a funeral director.

769
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,630
My name is Choi Seok-jun.

770
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:38,632
All right, then, what is a funeral?

771
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,175
Turn to page 48.

772
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:44,972
Let's take a look at the process
and the meaning of the modern funeral.

773
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:48,433
You can read the opening paragraph
at home if you'd like.

774
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:53,230
In a three-day funeral,
there are many tasks that you must do.

775
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:57,734
On the first day, the day the person dies,
the body is moved and placed in a coffin.

776
01:05:57,818 --> 01:06:01,822
Plans are then made for the funeral
and a funeral home is chosen,

777
01:06:01,905 --> 01:06:05,367
and mourners come after the news
of the death has been announced.

778
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,703
On the second day,
the corpse is dressed, and…

-Hey, Ok-ja.
-Yes, sir.

How old are you? This song's old.

790
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,198
It's because I have an old-fashioned name.

791
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:37,686
How dare you touch my money?

792
01:08:43,608 --> 01:08:44,776
Put it down.

The manager here owes us
160 million won in gambling debt,

but this is only 50 million.

796
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:01,918
What shall we do? When will you
give me the other 110 million?

01:09:15,182 --> 01:09:19,352
Boss. You can leave first.
We'll take care of the rest here.

798
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,813
If we're lucky,

799
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:24,774
we might be able to get
the rest of the money.

800
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:30,280
Did you all take classes
to learn to talk like that?

801
01:09:31,156 --> 01:09:33,116
How do you all sound exactly the same?

802
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,286
"I wasn't good in school, I'm a dropout."

803
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:40,957
Hey, Woo-bin.

01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:43,710
Kim Woo-bin.

805
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:45,629
Yes, sir!

806
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,339
Close the shop.

807
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:49,674
We won't be opening today.

808
01:09:51,927 --> 01:09:54,346
Close the shop! We're not open today!

809
01:09:54,429 --> 01:09:55,514
You bastard!

810
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:42,871
Hey, Chun-ja.

811
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,710
Chun-ja. Hey.

812
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:50,712
Hey.

813
01:11:50,795 --> 01:11:51,671
Chun-ja.

814
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:53,798
Hey.

815
01:11:54,382 --> 01:11:55,467
Yes…

816
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:56,509
Yes, sir.

820
01:13:22,345 --> 01:13:23,930
You're now one of the people

821
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:31,187
who come to me
in the morning when I'm sober.

822
01:13:32,856 --> 01:13:36,609
You're one of the people who make me
curse from the moment I wake up.

823
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:38,987
Hyeon-jin.

824
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:44,284
I'll welcome you back.

825
01:13:47,203 --> 01:13:48,913
I'll welcome you with arms wide open,

826
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,668
so I hope to see you again alive.
