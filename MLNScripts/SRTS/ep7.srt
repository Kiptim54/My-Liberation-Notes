00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:08,727
MY LIBERATION NOTES

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,845
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

3
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,605
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,048
You sit there under an umbrella
while everyone's working.

5
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,743
Don't you feel sorry for them?

6
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,060
They're not working right now, you know!

7
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:36,304
They're on a date.

8
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,264
Jeez.

9
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,497
God, it's hot.

10
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,474
The weather's so freaking hot today.

11
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:55,286
Gosh.

12
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:58,636
God, he's trying so hard.

13
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:00,208
Jeez.

14
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:02,731
Let's go.

15
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:11,869
You should've parked in the shade.

16
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:14,310
It was in the shade earlier.

17
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,535
You should've parked so it would be
in the shade when you came out.

18
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,900
How am I supposed to know that?

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,547
You don't even know
which way the sun sets?

20
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,490
Where will this shade move to later?

21
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:25,682
I'm sure it'll go wherever it wants to go.

22
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:29,735
When it snows,

23
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:35,732
it's amazing to have a barbecue here.

24
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,999
Watching the snow pile up
all around, you know?

25
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,273
When you grill meat on a campfire here,

26
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:44,293
you think, "Where am I?"

27
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,642
It feels unfamiliar

28
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,966
but cozy, you know?

29
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,330
Yes.

30
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:52,397
Sounds really nice.

31
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,996
You should invite us some time.

32
00:02:58,105 --> 00:02:59,966
Yes. Of course, yes.

33
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,248
You promise?

34
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,323
Yes.

35
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,466
Bye.

36
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:07,037
We'll be off then. Goodbye.

37
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,188
See you at school after the break.

38
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,000
Sure. Take care.

39
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,459
Why won't you accept payment
for the farm work?

40
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:34,704
It's because I like doing it.

41
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:38,426
Still, I feel bad
making you work for free.

42
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,419
Let me pay you.

43
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,479
It's really fine. I enjoy it.

44
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:46,077
But still, it doesn't sit right with us.

45
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,979
We should pay you for--

46
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,378
He says he enjoys it.
Well, why wouldn't he?

47
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:53,893
He enjoys it,
so take a hint and stop insisting.

48
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,537
What?

49
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:26,853
Keep at it.

50
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:31,650
I have you at my mercy.
How dare you glare at me like that?

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,854
What does it feel like to date
someone who lives in the area?

52
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,700
You're just like the people in Seoul,
dating within the neighborhood.

53
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:47,076
All this time, I thought
you had to take the bus and the train

54
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,846
to go all the way
to Seoul to meet someone.

55
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:54,603
I never even imagined you would be
able to find someone in this countryside.

56
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,539
It's so nice and economical.
You can even eat together at home.

57
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:15,734
GONDAL-RO ENTRANCE

58
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,164
Since you're tall and skinny, I can see
if you're on a bus even from afar.

59
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,687
I can see you too. Since you're fat.

60
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,902
I'm dying of hunger.

61
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:50,845
Are you that hungry?

62
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:52,417
I feel like I'm going to die.

63
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,518
Right. Go have dinner if you're hungry.

64
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,785
Come with me. Let's eat together.

65
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,308
No, I'm not hungry.

66
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:03,169
What's wrong?

67
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,676
What happened?

68
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,433
Apparently, Ms. Kwak

69
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,872
broke up with her boyfriend.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,952
All right.

71
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,708
Don't you have any coffee beans?

72
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:38,858
They're in the freezer.

73
00:06:41,298 --> 00:06:42,622
I'll have an iced americano.

74
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,441
Me too.

75
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,040
You said you weren't hungry.

76
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100
I was just pretending.

77
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,506
To look sentimental.

78
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:56,848
You're lucky I forced you to eat with me.

79
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,799
You know, right?

80
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:00,322
How much I hate being
messed with when I'm hungry.

81
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,491
When is Ms. Kwak going to get married?

82
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,849
She should already.

83
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:10,371
You always get hopeful
when she breaks up with someone,

84
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,480
and become hopeless
once she starts dating someone new.

85
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,450
At this rate, if she does get married,
you'll wait for her to get divorced.

86
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,214
I never waited for her. Ever.

87
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:26,169
You know already, right?

88
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,692
It's not going to work.

89
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,132
I know.

90
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,895
But…

91
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,830
when I heard that she broke up
with her boyfriend,

92
00:07:39,278 --> 00:07:41,553
my heart started beating fast again.

93
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:51,644
I don't get how you can like someone
so much that your heart pounds.

94
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:57,970
It's not that I've never
liked anyone that much.

95
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,742
I've never really liked anyone that much.

96
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:05,952
Anyway, my heart only pounds
when something bad is happening.

97
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,806
When I'm embarrassed,

98
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:10,873
when I'm angry,

99
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,521
before a 100-meter sprint…

100
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,457
It was always for bad things.

101
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,352
My heart never beat fast
because I liked someone.

102
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,818
When I really like someone,

103
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,367
I think the opposite happens.
My heart beats even slower.

104
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,683
Like I've been freed from something.

105
00:08:32,295 --> 00:08:36,349
Like I feel peace
in my heart for the first time.

106
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:42,841
I guess I'm just weird.

107
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:49,292
Mi-Jeong just gave the perfect answer.

108
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,635
When you're happy, you just are.

109
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,083
But your heart pounds

110
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,687
when you think
you have a chance at something.

111
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,301
Like some kind of expectation.

112
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,534
When something's yours, you just know.

113
00:09:01,616 --> 00:09:04,759
Does your heart pound when you get paid?
No, because it's yours.

114
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,192
But when it's not yours
and you know it's not,

115
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,714
but you think you might get it
if things work out…

116
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,575
That's when your heart starts pounding.

117
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,057
Relationships are the same.

118
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:16,835
Some married couples say,

119
00:09:16,918 --> 00:09:18,986
"I just knew they were the one
at first sight."

120
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,342
If you ask them, they say when they met,

121
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,948
it was like, "You're the one."

122
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,726
Their hearts didn't beat like crazy,

123
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,001
but they were just like, "You're the one."

124
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,151
You just know that it's yours.

125
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:34,948
Relationships are like that.
There's nothing to long for. It's yours.

126
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:38,133
Rich people don't yearn
for designer clothes. They just buy them.

127
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:43,964
When you desperately long for something,
your soul already knows deep down

128
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,412
that it's not yours.

129
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:49,754
You want it, but you know it's not yours.
That's what drives you crazy.

130
00:09:52,814 --> 00:09:53,682
Damn it!

131
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,088
Oh, my God!

132
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:58,149
So that's why I can't have a car.

133
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:04,145
Well, tell your soul that you can have it.

134
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,461
You try. You try telling your soul.

135
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:10,389
That things might work out with her.
You try making your soul admit that.

136
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,270
Damn it.

137
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:23,003
GYEONGGI SANPO POLICE STATION

138
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,880
Your household register is missing.
Please bring it next time you visit.

139
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,526
But I submitted it last time.

140
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:38,387
They ask for it every time.

141
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:46,328
GENERAL AFFAIRS

142
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,511
-All right. Thank you. Have a good day.
-Thank you. You too.

143
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,268
YEOM JE-HO, KWAK HYE-SUK,
YEOM GI-JEONG, YEOM CHANG-HEE

144
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:02,208
Excuse me?

145
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,235
I think there's a mistake here.

146
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:07,336
There should be five people,
but there are only four.

147
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Four is correct, sir.

148
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:18,750
But Yeom Mi-Jeong is missing.

149
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,024
Ms. Yeom Mi-Jeong…

150
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,994
recently moved her address.

151
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:29,337
To where?

152
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,976
I think you should ask your daughter.

153
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,488
SANPO SINKS

154
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:30,501
YEOM JE-HO, KWAK HYE-SUK,
YEOM GI-JEONG, YEOM CHANG-HEE

155
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,642
YEOM MI-JEONG

156
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:10,409
I'll be late today.
I have a club meeting at work.

157
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,890
Did I tell you what club it is?

158
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,943
It's called The Liberation Club.
It's for people who want to be liberated.

159
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,548
There are only three members.

160
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:28,150
Mi-Jeong, you're coming with us today.
All right?

161
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,418
I'm definitely putting some
colored varnish on your poor nails today.

162
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,725
I have a club meeting today.

163
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:38,737
What on earth do you talk
about with two middle-aged men?

164
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,640
She said it's four today.

165
00:13:41,343 --> 00:13:42,625
You already got another member?

166
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:45,477
The team leader of the Joy Support Center
is sitting in today.

167
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:47,587
She's even sitting in?

168
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,737
She must be suspecting the same thing.

169
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,583
That they made up a fake club
and actually do nothing.

170
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,305
Just come clean
before they find out it's fake.

171
00:13:57,388 --> 00:13:58,877
Just tell them you're sorry

172
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,565
and come with us
to do our nails. All right?

173
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,385
-Come on.
-Let's do our nails together.

174
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:40,605
Throw out.

175
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:43,954
Throw out.

176
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,296
Throw out.

177
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,364
Oh, my…

178
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:53,300
You're organizing things
for real this time?

179
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,642
You should've brought stuff home
little by little. How overwhelming.

180
00:14:57,725 --> 00:14:59,463
You know how far I live.

181
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:03,970
When I carry something heavy on
my way home, I just want to throw it away.

182
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,161
I even want
to toss out my own body somewhere.

183
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:07,857
Throw out.

184
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,098
Throw out.

185
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:12,737
Hey, can you come over to my office?
I have too much to carry by myself.

186
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,922
What club?

187
00:15:16,004 --> 00:15:17,741
When will you be done?

188
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,892
Damn it!

189
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,125
Then what do I do?

190
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:27,253
After breathing, what I do the most

191
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,561
is look at this watch.

192
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:34,449
I look at it so often, over and over.

193
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:38,129
"Time really flies.
Is it this late already?"

194
00:15:38,998 --> 00:15:42,595
Just like that, I look at it all day long.
24 hours a day.

195
00:15:42,678 --> 00:15:46,565
I go to work, finish work, eat, and sleep.
Every day is the same.

196
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,701
So why do I keep looking at my watch?

197
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:58,435
I think I feel a compulsion
to live a productive day,

198
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,247
but there's not much to show for it.

199
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,762
I'm just constantly looking at my watch
and being chased by time.

200
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,883
As soon as I realized
I've lived that way my whole life,

201
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,439
weirdly, my heart suddenly started

202
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:22,007
to pound like thump, thump, thump.

203
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:26,763
Before, it was like bam-bam-bam-bam.

204
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,827
I can't believe it took me about 50 years
to realize this.

205
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,933
I'm kind of like that too.

206
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,861
Doesn't everyone
experience something like that?

207
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:52,403
And since you spent
all your time wisely like that,

208
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,057
not wasting a single second,

209
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,159
you were able to become
an important member within the company.

210
00:16:57,242 --> 00:17:00,467
"Do not give advice.
Do not try to comfort."

211
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,073
Those are the rules of our club.

212
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,595
Okay, sure.

213
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:09,648
I may not be able to be completely
liberated from time,

214
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,204
but resting when I've done enough,

215
00:17:13,288 --> 00:17:15,314
and waking up when I've slept enough…

216
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,126
Finding my own rhythm like that

217
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:21,683
might be the liberation I need the most.

218
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:26,397
So I've decided
to name my plan "Finding My Own Rhythm."

219
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:30,946
My time is up.

220
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:36,363
We divided up the speaking time
by the number of people here.

221
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,292
Otherwise only talkative people like me
would speak.

222
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,608
That's nice.

223
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:47,323
Who's next?

224
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,353
May I?

225
00:17:54,436 --> 00:17:55,718
Sure.

226
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,711
Thank you.

227
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,211
STOP FEELING ****

228
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,395
Why is this…

229
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,448
I was worried someone would see.

230
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,505
Someone's been calling you.
Should we take a break?

231
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,579
Shall we?

232
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,109
It's fine. We don't have to.

233
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,178
Let's take a ten-minute break.

234
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,411
-All right.
-Sure, that's fine with me.

235
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:35,873
I like it.

236
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:38,810
Now that I've participated,

237
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,077
I can see exactly
what kind of club this is.

238
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,310
I also liked your

239
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:47,329
"Someone who makes me happy
when I think of them."

240
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:51,258
It's very good. The Liberation Club.

241
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:53,863
Excuse me.

242
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:55,228
Go ahead.

243
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,288
Yes.

244
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,728
I've been calling you forever! You…

245
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,995
Come out. I'm here, just come out.

246
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,732
You said you would be done by nine.

247
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:08,213
It's almost nine, so just come out.

248
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,405
I'm so exhausted.

249
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:13,879
Just tell them you live far away.
I'm sure they'll let you go.

250
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,511
Hey, what kind of club
has only three people in it?

251
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,365
I have a lot of stuff with me.

252
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,342
So what do I do? Do you want me
to sleep on the street tonight?

253
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:26,327
-Excuse me.
-Yes. How…

254
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:30,504
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:33,440
Hi.

256
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:35,549
What are you doing here?

257
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:38,072
Well, I was meeting someone here.

258
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:39,808
I see.

259
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,200
Fancy running into you here.

260
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:45,474
I'm waiting for Mi-Jeong, by the way.

261
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:46,921
Since I have so much to carry,

262
00:19:47,005 --> 00:19:49,817
we were going to go home together,
but she has some club thing.

263
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:52,918
But she's never had
any interest in those things.

264
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,358
Oh, my God! You're in the same club,
aren't you?

265
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:56,392
Well…

266
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,114
-Yes.
-Okay.

267
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,505
Why didn't she tell me that?

268
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,400
-So you're in the same club.
-Yes.

269
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:08,881
This is Mi-Jeong's sister.

270
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:10,701
-Okay.
-Okay.

271
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:12,272
Nice to meet you.

272
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:20,461
We'll be done soon.
Why don't you wait inside? It's cooler.

273
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,513
Come in. We're almost done.

274
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,028
Shall I?

275
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,634
Carry that for me.

276
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,661
-Let me.
-No, it's…

277
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:38,533
Those books are as heavy as bricks.

278
00:20:39,602 --> 00:20:40,801
Please, take your time.

279
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,060
Well, shall we wrap it up? She's waiting.

280
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,136
No.

281
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,072
Just finish it up. Take your time.

282
00:20:49,154 --> 00:20:51,512
Don't mind me, and take your time.

283
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:57,384
Where were we?

284
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:01,065
I don't think it's necessary
to do this often.

285
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:04,291
Everyone has their own life

286
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,772
-and we have work to do.
-Okay.

287
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:19,179
After I lost my dad in fifth grade,

288
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,818
I also lost my mom
when I was in sixth grade.

289
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:28,731
When I went to school
after my mom's funeral…

290
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:34,770
the kids made me fight someone.

291
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:37,706
Someone who could never beat me.

292
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:42,916
He was big but didn't know how to fight.

293
00:21:44,074 --> 00:21:46,680
But the mood was weird.

294
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:53,007
It felt like I had to lose.

295
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:55,819
So…

296
00:21:57,846 --> 00:21:59,004
I let him win.

297
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:04,793
"So this is what it's like

298
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,192
to have no parents."

299
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,741
It felt like I lost one of my arms

300
00:22:12,858 --> 00:22:14,429
when I lost my dad.

301
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,937
When my mother passed away too…

302
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:23,114
it felt like both my arms were gone.

303
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:32,418
What if…

304
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,851
my daughter also…

305
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:40,938
feels like she's lost an arm?

306
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:03,890
You're coming home now?

307
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,976
I think you got even prettier today.

308
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:18,446
I never walked home

309
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,507
when she was younger.

310
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:23,658
I ran

311
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:25,807
because I couldn't wait for us to meet.

312
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:31,349
When I arrived,
that little girl would scream with joy.

313
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:36,561
-She would spin around in place.
-Dokdo is our land.

314
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:42,722
We were both so happy then.

315
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,865
As if we could soar high past the skies.

316
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:54,260
Ever since my parents passed away,

317
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:57,941
I've had this feeling of weakness
inside me.

318
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:02,738
I need to liberate myself
from this feeling

319
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:05,757
for my daughter to get over it too.

320
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,848
STOP FEELING WEAK

321
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:43,473
What's Cho Tae-hun's phone number?

322
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,766
I just want to ask him something.

323
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,936
He's my friend's little brother.

324
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:01,628
I'll hunt down
those bastards who put him in that fight.

325
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,989
There's watermelon in the fridge.
Have some after you wash up.

326
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,504
Hey.

327
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:26,441
I'm so afraid of having someone
who's really precious to me.

328
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,798
I mean, she's just my niece,

329
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,065
but I'm so scared
that something might happen to her.

330
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:34,092
It must be worse for you.

331
00:25:37,731 --> 00:25:41,742
It's amazing how you deal with that fear.

332
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:45,547
You just do.

333
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,069
You just do when the time comes.

334
00:26:00,063 --> 00:26:01,841
What's wrong? Have a few more drinks.

335
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm done.

336
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:12,924
I'm home.

337
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,529
I'm home.

338
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,712
-See you later.
-See you tonight.

339
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:48,448
All right. Have a good day.

340
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,637
Where did you change your address to?

341
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:13,261
What do you mean?

342
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:15,991
She's not on the household register.

343
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,453
My friend asked me…

344
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,589
to change my address to her place.

345
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:34,890
What for?

346
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:38,363
My friend…

347
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:43,823
had filed for bankruptcy,

348
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,635
so she couldn't sign a lease.

349
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,992
So I did it for her.

350
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,176
Are you insane? Seriously.

351
00:27:56,063 --> 00:27:57,056
Move it back to here.

352
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,771
You shouldn't do that,
no matter how close she is.

353
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,582
You should keep your records clean.

354
00:28:05,948 --> 00:28:08,139
Don't deal with people
who ask you to sign things

355
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,373
or ask for you to stand surety for them.

356
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:37,791
So…

357
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,065
About my dad's store…

358
00:28:40,644 --> 00:28:43,001
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
for you to manage?

359
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:46,352
Why would it be? It's fine with me.

360
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,810
Why don't I do it?

361
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:54,995
-Why don't you give it to me?
-No. I can do it.

362
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,882
I mean,

363
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:03,017
won't it be uncomfortable if the store
owner is your colleague's father?

364
00:29:03,928 --> 00:29:05,126
Uncomfortable? Never.

365
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,345
I treat all of the store owners
like my own mother and father.

366
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,330
Gosh.

367
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:13,646
My dad's hard to deal with.

368
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:16,541
My dad isn't a walk in the park either.

369
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:21,627
All right then.

370
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,984
Am I crazy? Why would I give it to her?

371
00:29:24,068 --> 00:29:25,680
The daily revenue there is huge.

372
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,038
Who knows what she'll do with it?

373
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,229
She'll probably plot with her dad

374
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,917
and order tons of the new products
to get a promotion.

375
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,605
She thinks she's the only smart one.

376
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:40,403
Gosh, you've put a stop
to A-reum's plan for an easy promotion.

377
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,678
Of course.
That store's under my management.

378
00:29:43,752 --> 00:29:46,648
Even A-reum must be the perfect girl
to some guy, right?

379
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,550
She's good at work and makes good money.

380
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,321
That guy will never be my friend.

381
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,091
I'll hate him. I don't even
have to meet him to know that.

382
00:29:57,854 --> 00:30:00,378
Give me a list of the people
who put you in that fight.

383
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,155
I can't just let it slide.

384
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:04,843
I spent all last night
running simulations in my head.

385
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,498
I've already planned out

386
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:09,640
all the things I'll do to them,
all the curses I'll say,

387
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,006
and with what expression.

388
00:30:11,088 --> 00:30:12,949
Just give me the list.

389
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,059
I'm good friends with them now.

390
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,112
How? Why? For what reason?

391
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,510
It happened when we were young.

392
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,867
Being young is no excuse.

393
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,811
Just give me the list

394
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:38,383
so I can at least curse them!

395
00:30:45,868 --> 00:30:47,811
You're my sister's friend. Why don't you…

396
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:58,109
I'll find out myself at all costs.

397
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,214
I've…

398
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:08,654
got to run now.

399
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:10,515
Have a good lunch.

400
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:37,355
I was wondering if anything else
might be sent in the mail.

401
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,201
I can't let my family find out.

402
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:44,799
Mail is sent when there's a delinquency,

403
00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:48,479
a change in the interest rate,
or if a notice needs to be given.

404
00:31:52,573 --> 00:31:54,476
What about filing a lawsuit?

405
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:57,412
Your account has the transaction records.

406
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,191
You can file a lawsuit with that.

407
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:05,270
You can't keep paying it off for him
forever like this.

408
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:07,007
It's not a small amount.

409
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:18,338
HANJO BANK

410
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,083
My family is about to find out that
I took out a loan to lend you money.

411
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,647
We need to talk today. Call me.

412
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:37,237
Hey. Aren't you going home?

413
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,035
-No, I'm going to head out later.
-Why?

414
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,226
I have plans.

415
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,625
Plans? That's rare.

416
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:47,700
See you tomorrow.

417
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:49,354
-See you.
-Bye.

418
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:07,923
I'm not going home until you pick up.

419
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:29,345
Hello?

420
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,157
It's me, Se-yeong.

421
00:33:35,134 --> 00:33:36,375
Why are you picking up?

422
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,428
I have nothing to talk about with you.

423
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:43,530
Let me talk to Chan-hyeok.

424
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:48,285
I'm really sorry, Mi-jeong,

425
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,222
but Chan-hyeok really doesn't have money.

426
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,413
He honestly doesn't.

427
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,515
I had him come over
because he might actually die

428
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,334
if he stayed in Korea.

429
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,049
Soon, my cards will be frozen,

430
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,447
and I'll become a delinquent borrower.

431
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,790
Why should I become a delinquent borrower?

432
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:14,008
I'm really sorry,

433
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,407
but I don't know what to do.

434
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,072
I'm also living from hand to mouth.

435
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:29,392
-Who is it?
-It's nothing.

436
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:30,798
Tell me who it is.

437
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:32,949
-Give it here.
-Just leave it.

438
00:34:33,032 --> 00:34:34,314
I said, give it to me!

439
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,776
What are you two doing over there?

440
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:49,326
I guess you had the money to fly there?

441
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:52,220
I came to sell my organs.

442
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,333
I guess you haven't sold any yet?

443
00:35:05,123 --> 00:35:07,976
I'll be a delinquent borrower soon.
Then I'll have to quit my job.

444
00:35:10,169 --> 00:35:12,402
Your family has money, don't they?

445
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,868
They can pay it off for you so why would
you become a delinquent borrower?

446
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:22,121
Why should I ask my family
when it's your fault?

447
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,289
I'll pay you back.
But since it's urgent, pay it first.

448
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:29,192
I'll pay you back later.

449
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:32,873
What do you expect me to do?
I literally have no money right now.

450
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,042
Whatever you do,
you can make at least 1,500,000 won.

451
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:42,301
Hey, do you think you're the only one
asking me to pay them back?

452
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:47,140
I'm trying my best to make money, but
they're chasing me and ruining everything,

453
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:49,662
telling me to cough it up immediately.

454
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:52,474
How can I do that
unless I steal it from somewhere?

455
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,701
They blame me if I sleep,
they blame me if I eat.

456
00:35:55,783 --> 00:35:58,595
Unless I starve to death,
they'll never believe me.

457
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:03,144
Stop trying to say I'm not
paying you back because I don't want to!

458
00:36:07,528 --> 00:36:09,183
How could you do this to me?

459
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,525
How could you do this to me?

460
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,720
Don't. Stop it!

461
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,600
Stop it!

462
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,752
I don't know how it got like this.

463
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:15,682
I just decided to focus on one thing only.

464
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,501
Jung Chan-hyeok…

465
00:37:18,618 --> 00:37:21,016
I won't let him die while he's by my side.

466
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,693
Drink slowly.

467
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,104
It's me, you know. It's exactly me.

468
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,874
No one could feel weak
if they were with me.

469
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:54,348
I'm the pick-up girl,
the girl who's like a Jindo dog.

470
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,442
All he has to do is be with me.

471
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,213
I want to tell him it's me so badly.

472
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:12,710
You know, I really want to tell him
to go out with me right now.

473
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:14,943
Should I just say it?

474
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,147
What?

475
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:23,132
Why shouldn't I?

476
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:24,703
Who said you shouldn't?

477
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:27,639
Hey, I'm turning 40 soon.

478
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,666
I decided to love anyone this winter.

479
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:32,478
But he isn't just anyone,
not by a long shot.

480
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,925
He's a genuinely decent guy.

481
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:36,034
Tell him if you want to.

482
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,749
How can someone change so much
in just one month?

483
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:43,313
Remember what you said here a month ago?

484
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,952
Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?

485
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,689
A slap in his face won't cut it.

486
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,550
I should just put three bullets in him.

487
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:58,779
Time's a fickle friend, right?

488
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:50,102
Why is it so difficult
to tell someone you like them?

489
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,493
It's not like you're telling them
you hate them.

490
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:58,786
Because your soul knows
you're going to get rejected for sure.

491
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:04,079
If you hesitate to say something
but then actually say it,

492
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:06,106
you're guaranteed to regret it.

493
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:09,208
You hesitate
because you know you shouldn't say it.

494
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:13,922
But you still end up saying it
and making yourself miserable.

495
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:18,264
Humans are really nonsensical animals,
you know?

496
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:24,591
Du-hwan.

497
00:40:26,121 --> 00:40:29,306
Stray puppy, egg white, one-won coin.

498
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,986
What's wrong with you,
you unbearably old-fashioned egg white?

499
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,667
Don't do it.

500
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:40,885
Just don't.

501
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,615
You know what Gi-Jeong said?

502
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:48,288
She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone
because they told her they liked her.

503
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:54,119
She wanted to shoot anyone
who smiled or winked at her.

504
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,732
She was always looking for a gun.

505
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:57,717
If someone below her standards liked her,

506
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,785
she would go off
as if they had insulted her.

507
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:01,398
Girls, you know?

508
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,375
If a guy they think is below them
says he likes them,

509
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:06,691
they get deeply insulted.

510
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,454
Every girl in the world is like that.

511
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:12,687
Except Hyeon-a.

512
00:41:14,011 --> 00:41:16,534
Everyone used to like her
when we were in school, right?

513
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:20,545
Seriously, literally everyone, including
some weirdos, said they liked her.

514
00:41:21,538 --> 00:41:24,929
She was so kind even to them.

515
00:41:25,756 --> 00:41:27,493
Even when she was rejecting them.

516
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:30,098
When we were in college,

517
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,199
I saw her get rejected by guys
a few times.

518
00:41:34,523 --> 00:41:35,763
But she didn't…

519
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,396
She didn't even get mad, you know?

520
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,952
She didn't even get embarrassed
or anything.

521
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,640
She always used to be grateful

522
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:49,163
to the boys who liked her at school
when she was young.

523
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,313
So she assumes others feel that way.

524
00:41:52,057 --> 00:41:55,200
That's why Hyeon-a is the only one of us
who's always dating.

525
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:57,764
Yeom Gi-jeong?
She's going to love anyone this winter?

526
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,115
I don't think so. She can't.
Nothing's happened so far.

527
00:42:01,197 --> 00:42:04,175
There's no way someone decent
will ask her out all of a sudden.

528
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:09,385
That means she has to ask first.
Someone decent or literally anyone.

529
00:42:09,468 --> 00:42:12,197
But how will she,
knowing what she's done in her life?

530
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,051
Maybe the guy will end up
shooting her dead.

531
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:21,130
What I'm saying is that it's her karma.

532
00:42:22,577 --> 00:42:24,770
But you went out with anyone too easily.

533
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:26,548
Mi-rim really wasn't a good idea.

534
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,491
I had no choice. She said she liked me.

535
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,138
But still. I can't believe you dated her.

536
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:32,461
Hey, that's enough.

537
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:34,282
She's someone's mom now.

538
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:35,604
I'm home.

539
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,683
-You're here.
-Hey.

540
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:55,000
Who asked who out first?

541
00:42:58,432 --> 00:42:59,342
With Mr. Gu, I mean.

542
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:03,932
I did.

543
00:43:08,937 --> 00:43:10,591
I didn't ask him to go out with me.

544
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,388
I told him to worship me.

545
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:17,745
What?

546
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,268
I told him to worship me.

547
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:09,439
SLIDE TO ANSWER

548
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:14,154
Yes?

549
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,552
Hello?

550
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:19,158
Yes, what?

551
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,970
Hey, you asshole. How could you…

552
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,594
How could you ignore a message
from your brother saying he was dying?

553
00:44:28,173 --> 00:44:33,135
If I were really dying,
I would've killed you before I died.

554
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,741
Where are you hiding?
Are you even in Seoul?

555
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,813
Sam-sik ran into
Chairman Shin at a funeral recently.

556
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,832
Apparently, he asked
if he was in contact with you.

557
00:44:46,907 --> 00:44:50,174
You know he's not important enough
to be able to talk to the chairman.

558
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:53,151
But it seemed the old man
followed him to the restroom.

559
00:44:55,013 --> 00:44:59,727
I'm hearing that Mr. Baek
has fallen out of favor with the chairman.

560
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,351
If we just step in here,
it'll be over for Mr. Baek.

561
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,438
Hey, are you listening?

562
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,126
How's Ssaebi doing?

563
00:45:13,663 --> 00:45:14,491
Ssaebi?

564
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:16,311
Yes.

565
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:19,618
How would I know?
I haven't seen him in ages either.

566
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,893
Why do you ask about Ssaebi?

567
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:24,871
Did someone take your money?

568
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:27,766
How much?

569
00:45:33,184 --> 00:45:36,037
NAME: YEOM MI-JEONG

570
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:46,582
Have you looked into this?
You'd probably be at the top of the list.

571
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:51,131
I just want to close the account.

572
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,749
It will mature in four months.

573
00:46:10,072 --> 00:46:11,644
HANJO BANK
LOAN PAYMENT RECEIPT

574
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:20,038
Thank you.

575
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:24,836
Miss.

576
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:26,945
Cheer up.

577
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,156
DANGMI TOWN OFFICE

578
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:00,112
Did you buy something?

579
00:47:01,394 --> 00:47:02,800
Why are you here at this hour?

580
00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:08,259
I had something to take care of.
I asked for a half-day off.

581
00:47:10,823 --> 00:47:12,560
You must have finished early today.

582
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:31,170
It's not that hot today.

583
00:47:31,873 --> 00:47:33,403
Seems like summer's almost over.

584
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:58,960
I've changed my address back.

585
00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:02,682
What if more mail comes?

586
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:04,792
That won't happen.

587
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,190
I sorted it out.

588
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:10,540
Did you pay it off for him?

589
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:14,178
He says he'll pay me back later.

590
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:18,811
I'm sure he will.

591
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:24,435
What's this asshole's name?

592
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:29,315
Don't worry. He says he will.

593
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,285
I just need his name and phone number.

594
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:36,097
I won't do it myself.
Someone else will do it.

595
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,154
Are you still not over him?

596
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:29,797
You're scaring me.

597
00:49:31,162 --> 00:49:32,278
Why don't you sit down?

598
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:37,737
How far do you want me to go?

599
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,327
You could've just told me that I dealt
with it well without making a mess.

600
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:45,718
Why do you keep bringing me down?

601
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:50,599
I'm the kind of idiot,

602
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:54,238
you only see on the internet
that gives money away to guys.

603
00:49:55,313 --> 00:49:58,663
Do you want my parents and
everyone in the world to know that?

604
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,742
You're scared of that, aren't you?

605
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,077
That bastard knows you are.
That's why he's doing this to you.

606
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,622
After money got involved,

607
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:24,676
he treated me like some headache,
but I put up with it.

608
00:50:26,164 --> 00:50:29,225
Whenever he was annoyed,
it felt like it was all my fault.

609
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,071
I felt guilty asking him to pay me back.

610
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:37,082
It feels like it's my fault
for getting myself in this situation.

611
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,729
That's just who I am.

612
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:44,071
I can never understand those
who help women divorce

613
00:50:44,153 --> 00:50:46,841
and rip off their problematic husbands.

614
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,944
Just leave me be.

615
00:50:50,895 --> 00:50:54,078
Even if I look like an idiot,
just leave me be.

616
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:55,981
Don't try to help me unless I ask you.

617
00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:00,778
People like me can't see things to an end
with people the way you want.

618
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:05,038
Even fighting with someone is hard for me.

619
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,602
So how can you expect me
to fight him to the end?

620
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,632
You don't seem to have a problem
fighting with me.

621
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:18,023
Because…

622
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,091
you like me.

623
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,648
You can do anything
in front of someone who likes you.

624
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,107
That's why

625
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,167
you should worship an idiot like me.

626
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:46,889
So I can get so confident
that I might even come to love myself

627
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,066
and be able to tell that bastard
everything I want to say.

628
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,003
I want you to make me that person.

629
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,476
Someone who doesn't worry
about other people knowing

630
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,834
and doesn't care what others think.

631
00:52:01,653 --> 00:52:02,935
So worship me.

632
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:28,162
Eat.

633
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,189
You were trembling.

634
00:52:42,057 --> 00:52:43,091
Come eat.

635
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:51,279
This is me worshiping you.

636
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,057
Come eat.

637
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:09,103
Water.

638
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:43,428
You'll be surprised if you find out
what kind of person I am.

639
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,868
You know?

640
00:53:50,045 --> 00:53:51,616
I'm a scary person.

641
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:55,338
I won't even blink
if I was stabbed in the stomach.

642
00:53:58,523 --> 00:53:59,598
But…

643
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:02,782
you scare me.

644
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:07,331
I get nervous when you're in front of me.

645
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:10,557
And that annoys me
because it makes me feel like an idiot.

646
00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:14,651
But even though it annoys me…

647
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,753
I still wait for you.

648
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:21,516
Okay?

649
00:54:23,584 --> 00:54:25,032
You should know,

650
00:54:25,817 --> 00:54:26,727
Yeom Mi-jeong.

651
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,829
You should know who you are.

652
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,814
Keep going. I like it.

653
00:55:26,361 --> 00:55:27,477
They're strays.

654
00:55:28,883 --> 00:55:30,331
Seems like they were abandoned.

655
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:35,665
They must think it's safe there
since it's an open area.

656
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,403
They sleep there even when it rains.

657
00:55:39,346 --> 00:55:40,959
They must have had owners once.

658
00:55:51,753 --> 00:55:55,144
Don't go near them. It's better
not to get close to a barking dog.

659
00:56:06,475 --> 00:56:07,426
You got this.

660
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:29,014
Why are my emotions like this?

661
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:31,785
They just do whatever they want.

662
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:35,382
Nothing's happened, but they're just…

663
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:37,988
Does it make sense?

664
00:56:40,015 --> 00:56:42,082
This isn't in my control.

665
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:43,819
Something must be broken.

666
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:53,289
It's fine.

667
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:57,218
I may fall in love easily,
but I can hate people just as easily.

668
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:59,865
I fall in love in the morning
and hate them by the evening.

669
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:01,601
One day, I'll be like this again,

670
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:04,414
"That was close.
I'm so glad nothing happened."

671
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:10,038
The day I feel nothing will come.
It'll be like I never liked anyone.

672
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:17,855
Which one do you prefer?

673
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:20,956
Having no emotions just like before,

674
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:23,437
or being frustrated
since you like somebody?

675
00:57:27,159 --> 00:57:28,565
Damn it.

676
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:32,577
This is driving me nuts.

677
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:35,886
Why don't you just tell him?

678
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,525
Nicely and politely.

679
00:57:43,205 --> 00:57:44,156
I don't think I can.

680
00:57:45,438 --> 00:57:46,803
Why not?

681
00:57:55,653 --> 00:57:58,259
But how will she,
knowing what she's done in her life?

682
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:03,138
She wanted to get a gun to shoot someone
because they told her they liked her.

683
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:05,123
So how can she tell anyone she likes them?

684
00:58:05,206 --> 00:58:07,977
Maybe the guy will end up
shooting her dead.

685
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,857
She treated a guy who liked her so badly
because he was below her standard.

686
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,330
She must be scared to be treated that way.

687
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,301
There are so many people like me.

688
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:33,162
I'm not the only one.

689
00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:37,628
But why does it
feel like I'm the only one?

690
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:58,637
Please stay beside me

691
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:05,005
Please don't leave me

692
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,570
It's been a while since I had a good cry.

693
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:46,278
I'm so sorry.

694
00:59:48,387 --> 00:59:50,951
I was arrogant and rude.

695
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:55,293
To those people who got cursed at
for telling me their feelings,

696
00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:57,527
I'm sincerely praying for forgiveness.

697
00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:59,470
I was wrong.

698
00:59:59,553 --> 01:00:01,414
I'm so sorry.

699
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,722
If you still have a scar on your heart,

700
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:07,948
I pray that it will be healed tonight.

701
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:12,001
I sincerely wish for your happiness.

702
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,407
Thank you.

703
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,722
Thank you so much
for ever liking someone like me.

704
01:00:15,806 --> 01:00:16,674
Thank you.

705
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:20,727
Thank you. I hope you can forgive me
for everything.

706
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:30,445
I'll get going.

707
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:37,186
See you later.

708
01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:54,762
See you later.

709
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,908

01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:12,751
See you tonight.

SANPO SINKS

714
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:47,779
What?

715
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:49,847
Hey, wait.

716
01:01:50,467 --> 01:01:52,907
Wait. Hey, wait! Me too!

717
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:53,858
Hey!

718
01:01:55,016 --> 01:01:57,043
Me too.

719
01:01:59,028 --> 01:01:59,979
Scooch over.

TOWN BUS STOP

What? When did you get here?

722
01:02:25,453 --> 01:02:27,149
Her boyfriend gave us a ride.

723
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,143
Don't tell me…

MY LIBERATION NOTES

726
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:35,468
Does he have a lot of problems?

727
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:38,032
You always do that
when something is difficult to say.

728
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,845
A good aesthetic sense?
It's something you're born with.

729
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:42,622
Tell your boyfriend about him.

730
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:45,394
Do you really do it?

731
01:03:45,476 --> 01:03:48,330
"You are the greatest of all time.
You're incredibly magnificent."

732
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,067
I might do something wild.

733
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:51,555
I have somewhere to go.

734
01:03:51,637 --> 01:03:53,168
-Where?
-Sanpo.

735
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,822
I missed you.

736
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:57,304
I guess you really are in Gyeonggi-do.

737
01:03:57,924 --> 01:03:59,950
He'll ransack the area soon.

738
