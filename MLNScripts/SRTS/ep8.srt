MY LIBERATION NOTES

00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:14,000
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,775
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,123
Mi-jeong texts someone a lot these days.

6
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,749
There's a guy, isn't there?

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,627
Did you see what she said
on our chat by mistake yesterday?

8
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:28,963
"I'm off work now.
I just got on the train."

9
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,965
-I saw it.
-Yes, I saw it.

10
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,884
Who was that for?

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,385
Is it that guy?

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,346
The guy who ate at your house
and made you uncomfortable.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,347
It's him, isn't it?

14
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,058
Yes.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,936
-Really?
-No way.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,730
-No way.
-It was just a wild guess.

17
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,316
Seriously?

18
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,609
What happened?

19
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:57,074
What do you like about that guy?

20
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:02,163
Yes, what?

21
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,916
I don't know.

22
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,919
That's your answer to everything.

23
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:11,547
What do you like about him?

24
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:14,967
What makes him charming?

25
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:16,761
What attracted you?

26
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:27,521
It's okay. Take your time.

27
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:28,981
-Take your time.
-Yes.

28
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,526
He has no shell.

29
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:42,078
You know, there are people
who are very polite,

30
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:45,456
but it feels like it's just their shell.

31
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,334
A shell so hard

32
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,921
that it feels like you'll never
be able to reach the person inside.

33
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:55,091
But this guy

34
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,385
has no shell.

35
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,811
She called him "this guy."

36
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,104
So?

37
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:11,399
Can't you see a clear difference?

38
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:15,027
She called him "this guy"
when he's not here.

39
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:18,823
It means he's in here.

40
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:20,574
Gosh.

41
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:30,209
SANPO SINKS

42
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,293
For God's sake.

43
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,253
Damn.

44
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:18,716
I mean…

45
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,633
CHOI JUN-HO

46
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:21,260
Seriously.

47
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,970
This is not it. No.

48
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,388
ADD SHADOW
CHANGE COLOR COMBINATION!

49
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,848
Gosh.

50
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,766
SPACING?

51
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,478
For God's sake.

52
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,980
It'll be so nice not to hear that
during my vacation.

53
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,995
Tell your boyfriend about him.

54
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:49,872
I think I will.

55
00:03:58,964 --> 00:04:02,009
My goodness.

56
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,579
<i>I used to never understand
why people took pictures of everything,</i>

57
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,291
<i>but now I want to do it too.</i>

58
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,631
<i>This is the food I'm eating right now.
I wonder what you're eating.</i>

59
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,591
Why don't we…

60
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,844
The sky looks beautiful today.

61
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,220
You're right.

62
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:48,722
Isn't that what you call a vanilla sky?

63
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,727
-It's clearly a vanilla color.
-<i>The things I'm doing.</i>

64
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,147
-<i>The things I'm seeing.</i>
-The clouds look pretty.

65
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,525
-Or was it sky vanilla?
-<i>Why do I want to share them with you?</i>

66
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,695
<i>I know you wouldn't be interested.</i>

67
00:05:02,778 --> 00:05:03,863
It's pretty.

68
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:26,343
CHO TAE-HUN

69
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,053
CHO TAE-HUN:
I'VE GOT TO RUN NOW. HAVE A GOOD LUNCH.

70
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,013
SURE. YOU TOO.

71
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:40,149
I LIKE IT

72
00:05:40,232 --> 00:05:41,525
POP

73
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,280
POP

74
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,340
Shoot.

75
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,009
DELETE FOR EVERYONE

76
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,930
He wouldn't have seen it, right?

77
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,435
<i>I'm sorry. I sent that by mistake.</i>

78
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:24,777
Okay, I got it. Bye.

79
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,327
YEOM GI-JEONG:
DELETED MESSAGE

80
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,912
I'M SORRY. I SENT THAT BY MISTAKE.

81
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,766
<i>I wonder what it was.</i>

82
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:06,527
Your vacation starts tomorrow.
Do you have any plans?

83
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:14,368
What?

84
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:16,996
Well…

85
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:20,624
I might do something wild.

86
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:46,108
<i>I wonder what it was.</i>

87
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:03,584
<i>I wonder</i> <i>what it was.</i>

88
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,847
<i>I wonder what it was.</i>

89
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:27,399
<i>I miss you. Let's meet.</i>

90
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,027
Would you like a drink?

91
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,906
No, I don't drink when I eat.

92
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,492
I rarely eat and drink together.

93
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,705
You're truly a master of alcohol.

94
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,629
Can I ask you something?

95
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,093
Do you really do it?

96
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:40,848
Worship, I mean.

97
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,646
"You are the greatest of all time.
You're incredibly magnificent."

98
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,356
Do you do stuff like this?

99
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:57,406
Mi-jeong didn't ask him to date her.
She asked him to worship her.

100
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,450
And he said yes, apparently.

101
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,951
You did, right?

102
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,245
"<i>Heil, Hitler</i>.
You're the greatest of all time."

103
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,539
Isn't that what worship is?

104
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,210
Have pity on her.

105
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,213
She said she'd love
just anyone this winter,

106
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:14,673
but well…

107
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:15,632
She hasn't…

108
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:27,227
Call Mi-jeong and ask where she is!

109
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:40,032
She'll be late. She's still at work.

110
00:10:40,782 --> 00:10:41,950
Gosh.

111
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,162
She'll have to eat alone.

112
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,589
ADD SHADOW
CHANGE COLOR COMBINATION!

113

CREDIT CARD USER GUIDE

116
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,737
THANK YOU FOR JOINING JOY CARD.
WE WILL BE YOUR HAPPY COMPANION.

117
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:49,411
<i>Gosh. This isn't it.</i>

118
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,085
<i>If I imagine that I'm sitting here
working next to you,</i>

119
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,505
<i>even awful tasks like these
turn into something beautiful.</i>

120
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,133
<i>Work becomes bearable.</i>

121
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:09,890
<i>I'm playing a role
of a woman who is loved.</i>

122
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:12,643
<i>A woman who has everything she needs.</i>

123
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,821
Yeom Mi-jeong's imagination comes true.

124
00:14:29,928 --> 00:14:31,680
The way you drink is weird.

125
00:14:32,264 --> 00:14:34,349
You just sit still
as if you're spacing out.

126
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,560
I drink to feel high.

127
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:39,604
I…

128
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:43,525
drink to feel calm.

129
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,362
When I drink,

130
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,282
it feels like the puzzle pieces

131
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:57,581
that have been floating around
in my head fall into place.

132
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,627
It also makes me gentle, I think.

133
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:08,050
What goes around inside your head?

134
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:12,095
Curses.

135
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,225
I curse all day inside.

136
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,104
Curse at who?

137
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:22,981
I don't know.

138
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,068
There must be a story behind it.

139
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,862
There's no story. I just curse.

140
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,324
I always curse

141
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:36,036
except when I drink,

142
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,205
when I sleep,

143
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,333
and…

144
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,338
when I talk like this.

145
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,394
Mi-jeong told him to worship her.

146
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:04,856
She's unbelievable, isn't she?

147
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,612
Does he have a lot of problems?

148
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,449
I have a feeling he does.

149
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,910
I think Mi-jeong did that to save him.

150
00:16:16,993 --> 00:16:18,286
What?

151
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,919
SANPO SINKS

152
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:54,197
"You're the greatest of all time."

153
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,365
What are you doing?

154
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:39,618
I think that's Gu.

155
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,037
What?

156
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,081
Where?

157
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,625
In that truck over there.

158
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,476
Why would he be driving a truck?

159
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,092
That's Mi-jeong.

160
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,846
She never really looked at the camera
when she was little.

161
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,655
Turning the hip is still hard.

162
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,031
-What do you think?
-It looks great.

163
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:01,283
You think so? Look.

164
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:02,993
Yes.

165
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,162
It's better to straighten your arms.

166
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,836
-Did they finish reviewing?
-Yes.

167
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:16,840
Put it on my desk.

168
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,346
A good aesthetic sense?

169
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:26,099
It's something you're born with.

170
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:27,892
Sense of color?

171
00:19:27,976 --> 00:19:30,437
It's not something you can learn.

172
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,272
I agree.

173
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,697
This is what they chose
after thinking about it for a month?

174
00:19:42,824 --> 00:19:45,618
I wonder why they picked this
out of all the other green ones.

175
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,331
Do you know how it was chosen?

176
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:05,263
JOY CARD

177
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,146
My instinct tells me

178
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,941
that this is the one.

179
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:23,531
A bouquet in spring…

180
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:31,331
After all that time,
it was settled by one person's instinct?

181
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:32,832
The thing is,

182
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,252
I thought that was the best design
from the beginning.

183
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:42,384
But if I had told them,
would they have listened?

184
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,806
Those who deliver results
are always right.

185
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,558
We haven't delivered any results.

186
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:58,400
Still, I was grateful to her
for saying that.

187
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:03,863
I thought they were
in a different league from me,

188
00:21:05,073 --> 00:21:06,866
but they just follow their instincts.

189
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:13,164
I think you're unhappy
because you don't know how good you are.

190
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,008
Be gentle with the door.

191
00:21:24,092 --> 00:21:25,176
Good.

192
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,222
SUMMER VACATION
AUGUST 6 - AUGUST 11

193
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:33,726
Seriously. How much did you think
we were going to eat on an overnight trip?

194
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,729
We shouldn't have unpacked it.
Don't pack like this next time.

195
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:38,815
Stop yammering and move them.

196
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:39,941
I'm so sick of it.

197
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:41,401
All the packing and unpacking.

198
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:44,112
Going up and down
from the third floor. Seriously.

199
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,363
Jeez.

200
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:50,785
Hello?

201
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:53,538
Yes. I'll go pick it up.

202
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,622
Bye.

203
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:58,459
I have somewhere to go.

204
00:21:58,543 --> 00:21:59,502
Where?

205
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:05,508
Where are you going?

206
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,969
Someone's selling Nirvana's second album.

207
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:09,804
I'll go listen to it before I buy it.

208
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:12,015
-Where is it?
-Sanpo.

209
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,062
That's going to be a long trip.
You've been driving for hours already.

210
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:20,148
It won't take long.

211
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:23,735
Jeez, you should just buy it.
Why go through all that trouble?

212
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:26,613
There are some people
that sell unusable albums.

213
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,907
Boy, you'll be driving all day.

214
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,868
Hey, if it's Sanpo,
you could just ask Gi-jeong.

215
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:34,162
Hang on.

216
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:40,710
<i>I'm sorry for all the trouble.</i>

217
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:43,296
<i>No, it's close from here.
It won't take long.</i>

218
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:45,465
BUS STOP
SANPO

219
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,109
Here we go.

220
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:02,000
<i>You made scoring a good album so easy
for me. Thank you so much.</i>

221
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,626
<i>You're welcome.</i>

222
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,420
<i>I'm on vacation right now.</i>

223
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:09,048
<i>If you could ask Mi-jeong to give it
to me next week, I'd appreciate it.</i>

224
00:24:09,132 --> 00:24:11,217
<i>Sure, I will.</i>

225
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:15,263
<i>Thank you so much.
I'll treat you to a nice meal.</i>

226
00:24:15,346 --> 00:24:16,973
<i>I'll look forward to it.</i>

227
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:28,526
<i>I'm going to Seoul on Saturday.
Would you like me to give it to you then?</i>

228
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:38,494
<i>If I could have it even one day sooner,
that would be great.</i>

229
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:42,248
<i>What time should I meet you?</i>

230
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,267
I missed you.

231
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,903
MANAGER CHO TAE-HUN:

232
00:25:11,986 --> 00:25:14,030
I'LL GET IT FROM YOUR SISTER MYSELF
THIS SATURDAY

233
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:19,285
I SEE. OKAY.

234
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,638
GOING WITH THE FIRST DRAFT

235
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:51,025
Proper posture comes first.

236
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,944
Being accurate over being fast.

237
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,862
Okay. You're doing great.

238
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:57,407
Being accurate over being fast.
One, two, three, four…

239
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,950
Attention. Bow.

240
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,743
Thank you!

241
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:01,869
Good work, guys.

242
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,080
Hey, no running! Come on.

243
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,457
Walk! You'll hurt yourselves!

244
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,751
TEACHERS' ROOM

245
00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:17,927
KWAK HUI-SU

246
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:01,804
Come. Let's talk over dinner.

247
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,110
There's nothing romantic about apartments.

248
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,530
You can't see the house
of the woman you like from a distance.

249
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:30,666
I wish there was a day set by the country
where people confess their love.

250
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,462
For shy guys like me.

251
00:27:34,545 --> 00:27:38,966
My dad is shy, but he managed
to get married and have three kids.

252
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,596
<i>-This is good.
-There he goes with the left.</i>

253
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:46,432
My heart is running ahead,

254
00:27:47,058 --> 00:27:48,601
but there's nothing I can do.

255
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,269
I can't call her.

256
00:27:50,353 --> 00:27:54,315
I just keep looking at her profile
picture. I pine and fret all by myself.

257
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:57,318
If you put together all the pent-up energy
from people like me,

258
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,238
it'd be more than enough
to run a nuclear power plant.

259
00:28:01,322 --> 00:28:05,284
That's how much energy
I have bottled up inside me.

260
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,996
I mean, it's a big loss for the country.

261
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,040
Hey, think about it. Okay?

262
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,876
Let's say there's a day
and culture like that.

263
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,545
Then no one would have to waste

264
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:17,713
their energy fretting
over things like this.

265
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,424
How great would it be?
If it was approved by the country.

266
00:28:21,092 --> 00:28:25,513
There should also be a day where you
reject someone politely and considerately.

267
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,644
"With the country's approval,
I confess my feelings for you."

268
00:28:32,562 --> 00:28:33,688
"I love you."

269
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:36,315
The country could also tell you
how to reject someone.

270
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,234
"I'm sincerely grateful."

271
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:41,571
"But I already have someone I love."

272
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:46,117
If I file a petition for this,
I bet many people will support me.

273
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:48,703
Let me get this straight.

274
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:53,791
You know she'll say no
if you ask her out, but you can't give up.

275
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,669
You want to go for it,
but you don't want to get hurt.

276
00:28:57,295 --> 00:28:59,046
You want the country's help with that?

277
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:03,885
Everyone confesses their feelings,
gets rejected, and gets hurt.

278
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:06,178
Don't drag the country into this.

279
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:11,183
Well, they make new policies for
the minority and the weak all the time.

280
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,853
So how come there's no system
that protects the minority

281
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:15,646
and the weak in the world of dating?

282
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,691
You can't expect the country
to look after your faint heart too.

283
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,402
I'm saying, there should
be a culture like this.

284
00:29:21,485 --> 00:29:25,364
"I'm expressing my feelings for you

285
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:29,410
in the politest way possible
allowed by the social system."

286
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:32,622
In other words, a healthy dating culture.

287
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:36,000
You're telling people you like them,
not hate them. What's wrong with it?

288
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,377
Let's say it's approved by the country.

289
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:40,963
If you tell her,
will she reject you or not?

290
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:42,798
Let your soul answer.

291
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,175
Will she reject you or not?

292
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,094
You can't lose your job.

293
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,972
She's the principal's daughter.
What if it goes wrong?

294
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:53,601
If I get rejected,
I'll just say I don't remember.

295
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,898
I heard a story about two people
who had accidents while riding bikes.

296
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:01,776
Neither of them remembers the accident.

297
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:05,154
One of them was crossing a bridge
over the Han River on a bike,

298
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,657
but when he woke up,
he was in the hospital,

299
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,284
wearing a patient's gown.

300
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:12,244
He was like, "What's going on?"

301
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,497
He must've fallen at some point.

302
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:16,791
But he doesn't remember it at all.

303
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:19,669
He was riding a bike
and he just blacked out.

304
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:23,881
The other one remembers riding a bike
in the afternoon. Right?

305
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,884
But he woke up in the middle of the night
shivering in the cold

306
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:29,595
and found himself sprawled out in a bush.

307
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:33,140
He got a call from his friend,
and he asked,

308
00:30:33,224 --> 00:30:35,059
"Where am I? Why am I lying here?"

309
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:36,644
The strange thing is,

310
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:39,897
neither of them remembers what happened.

311
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,861
If I ask her out and get rejected,

312
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,783
come and hit me with your motorcycle.

313
00:30:50,866 --> 00:30:53,786
I'll bust out my acting chops
and pretend to pass out.

314
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,373
What will she do if I say
I don't remember? Have me fired?

315
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,041
You think she'd believe that?

316
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:05,589
I'll try.

317
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:12,847
I'll give it a go
and see if it works or not.

318
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:30,840
Just give me a little push
and I'll fall on my own.

319
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,258
Cut it out!

320
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:36,512
Is it that hard? It's just a little push.

321
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,013
Don't even think about it.

322
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,307
Who's the poor guy this time? Jeez.

323
00:31:41,976 --> 00:31:43,561
-Just--
-Here we go again!

324
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:46,397
Aren't you too old for this now? My God.

325
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,988
Hey, you better be there.

326
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,951
It's Saturday at 3 p.m.,
in a coffee shop near Gangnam Station.

327
00:31:59,034 --> 00:32:00,911
I'll text you the address.

328
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,128
<i>Yes.</i>

329
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,214
That's right. The color is spring bouquet.

330
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,301
Yes, I got it.

331
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:18,387
-By the way, about the brochures.
<i>-Yes.</i>

332
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,181
The first draft looks good,

333
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:23,225
but why does it always look bad
after the revision?

334
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,603
CHOI JUN-HO

335
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:26,687
I see.

336
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,772
I'll advise the employees.

337
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:30,524
All right.

338
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:40,993
GOING WITH THE FIRST DRAFT

339
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,668
Ms. Yeom.

340
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:53,631
Yes?

341
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:57,218
You uploaded the brochure
to the cloud storage, right?

342
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,303
Yes.

343
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,348
I'll take it from here.

344
00:33:02,973 --> 00:33:04,683
You worked hard. Go home early today.

345
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,169
SUPERMARKET

346
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:27,933
What about the booze?

347
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:30,060
Just these.

348
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,480
Buy them now if you're just going
to come back later.

349
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:08,515
I was so happy to see you
I almost hugged you.

350
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:20,069
Mi-jeong is doing a great deed.

351
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:30,621
I have this crazy friend
who used to live here.

352
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:34,958
She said she wanted to come and meet you,
but I told her not to.

353
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:38,295
I don't think you'll like each other.

354
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:41,840
Why not?

355
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,725
You always do that
when something is difficult to say.

356
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,229
You hesitate.

357
00:35:57,773 --> 00:35:59,024
You guys are similar.

358
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,567
In what way?

359
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,529
You're both tough.

360
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:09,159
You're both wild

361
00:36:10,285 --> 00:36:11,286
and transparent.

362
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,127
Transparent?

363
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:20,295
You're crazy.

364
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:23,590
You are transparent.

365
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:31,765
Are you worshiping me right now?

366
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,767
Yes.

367
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:48,031
ALPHA RETAIL

368
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,751
You applied for
the product development team.

369
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,628
Yes.

370
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:02,629
Why?

371
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,799
Because you might miss the promotion?

372
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,094
Or are you expanding your career path?

373
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:11,680
Well, yes.

374
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,061
Do you know eight people
applied for it from our branch alone?

375
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:21,440
They're hiring 3, but 67 people applied.

376
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:23,400
Have you ever beaten such odds?

377
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:26,653
I beat the odds of one in 100 million
when I was conceived.

378
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:32,284
Anyway, your chance
of getting promoted is one in ten.

379
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,287
So it's much better
to go all-in on the promotion.

380
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,080
Isn't it unreasonable to give up

381
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:39,416
the odds of one in ten
and go for one in twenty?

382
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:44,838
When you're driven into a corner,
you can't even do simple math.

383
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,092
What are you working on?

384
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:07,236
God damn it.

385
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,670
INCOMING CALL
SLIDE TO ANSWER

386
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,647
1 MISSED CALL

387
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:46,275
Just answer it.

388
00:38:55,742 --> 00:38:58,203
<i>Sam-sik said he saw you
at a gas station in Gyeonggi.</i>

389
00:38:58,287 --> 00:38:59,329
<i>Is it true?</i>

390
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:02,874
<i>He said you were driving a truck.
Is it true?</i>

391
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,086
<i>Baek was there too, you idiot.</i>

392
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:19,099
SANPO
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

393
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,561
<i>You called me straight away.
I guess you really are in Gyeonggi-do.</i>

394
00:39:22,644 --> 00:39:26,106
<i>You've been pretending to be somewhere far
when you were right outside Seoul?</i>

395
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,734
I didn't pretend.

396
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:33,780
<i>Sam-sik is sure it was you.
He'll ransack the area soon.</i>

397
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:37,367
<i>If Baek finds you, you're screwed.</i>

398
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:40,287
<i>You should pay him a surprise visit
and hit him from behind.</i>

399
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,706
<i>Let's throw the first punch, man.</i>

400
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,253
Well, look.

401
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,048
I'll do that eventually, but…

402
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:52,966
"But"?

403
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,178
I'm just

404
00:39:57,054 --> 00:39:58,221
too busy right now.

405
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:00,307
<i>Doing what exactly?</i>

406
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,561
-I have to go.
-<i>Wait, man. Hey--</i>

407
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,545
<i>Tomorrow at 3 p.m. I'll be at a cafe
named Troppo near Gangnam Station.</i>

408
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:31,880
Jeez.

409
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,008
LEAVE CHATROOM
CONFIRM

410
00:40:38,178 --> 00:40:39,805
YEOM CHANG-HEE LEFT HAS LEFT THE CHATROOM

411
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:42,140
YEOM GI-JEONG HAS INVITED YEOM CHANG-HEE

412
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:45,143
<i>I may not even tell him how I feel.</i>

413
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:47,938
<i>And if I do and it's not a big deal,
I won't do anything.</i>

414
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:50,607
<i>Just have my back like insurance.</i>

415
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:53,193
<i>If I get rejected, it'll be embarrassing
to walk away awkwardly.</i>

416
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,946
<i>I need to fall, tumble, or faint
and create some accident</i>

417
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:57,114
<i>to be less embarrassed!</i>

418
00:40:58,073 --> 00:40:59,533
YEOM CHANG-HEE LEFT HAS LEFT THE CHATROOM

419
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,964
<i>Do you know
who Gi-jeong is meeting tomorrow?</i>

420
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,731
Looking for something?

421
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:35,026
The minutes of the marketing meeting.

422
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,486
-The minutes?
-Yes.

423
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,114
I have it. Hang on.

424
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:41,867
Thank you.

425
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:59,092
You're not in the same department,
and he wouldn't use it against you.

426
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:00,177
So what's the problem?

427
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:05,599
You do all kinds of stuff
with a man whose name you don't even know.

428
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:07,559
I can't even tell a guy that I like him?

429
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,271
Don't push me,
or I'll tell him to worship me.

430
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:26,495
Eat before you go.

431
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:29,706
Don't starve to look thin.
You'll sweat a lot again.

432
00:42:42,177 --> 00:42:45,096
I listened to this every single day
back in high school.

433
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,893
When I listened to their music,
it took me somewhere before I knew it.

434
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,063
I wanted to hold on to that feeling,

435
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,525
so I listened to it over and over again.

436
00:42:59,694 --> 00:43:00,987
Like some kind of addict.

437
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:05,200
I think I know what you mean.

438
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,036
I've been listening to it
over the last few days.

439
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,746
The first track made me feel

440
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,457
like something was boiling up
from deep down inside.

441
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,419
I used to think it was noisy,
so I didn't listen to this kind of music.

442
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:20,006
But this time,
I felt something surging up within me.

443
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,843
I didn't know what it was,
but I could feel it.

444
00:43:24,553 --> 00:43:26,847
Right? Although you don't know what it is.

445
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:39,234
Getting to know someone
is an amazing thing.

446
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,028
It's not just that person.

447
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:45,240
It's like they bring
several universes with them.

448
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:51,246
For example, a universe called Nirvana.

449
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,005
I'm so excited.

450
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,053
I can't wait to go home

451
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:09,014
and listen to it.

452
00:44:16,271 --> 00:44:17,105
Hey.

453
00:44:19,065 --> 00:44:20,150
No, I won't be long.

454
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,068
Bye.

455
00:44:34,956 --> 00:44:35,790
How's it looking?

456
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,047
I have a feeling that he's from Seoul.

457
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:48,428
I hope Gi-jeong won't need us to do this.

458
00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:51,848
But she has us here
because she thinks it won't go well.

459
00:44:52,682 --> 00:44:54,726
With this,
your instincts are usually right.

460
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:58,021
That's what
I've been telling you every day.

461
00:44:58,104 --> 00:44:59,814
You get it now that it's about her?

462
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,984
Gosh, humans…

463
00:45:06,029 --> 00:45:09,199
I can't do it. I shouldn't have come here.

464
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,327
I can't believe I'm actually here.

465
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,547
What the hell.

466
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,593
Watch for her signal.

467
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,266
Please choose a date and let me know.

468
00:45:36,685 --> 00:45:37,519
Okay.

469
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,437
Get home safely.

470
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:46,361
Wait.

471
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:48,071
Yes?

472
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,491
It's nothing.

473
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:56,871
Wait.

474
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:04,421
I'm sorry. Never mind. Bye.

475
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:08,550
No, wait.

476
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:15,682
When there's something I want to say,
it's hard for me to hold it back.

477
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:19,227
I'll probably say this sooner or later,
so I'll just do it now.

478
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:22,480
Would you…

479
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:27,402
want to be in a relationship?

480
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:35,326
With me, I mean.

481
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:43,460
If that's too much pressure,
we could just date casually.

482
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:57,640
You're not messing with me, are you?

483
00:47:00,977 --> 00:47:03,605
Is this question that unexpected for you?

484
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:06,858
I thought you knew on some level.

485
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,528
Well…

486
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:14,199
You didn't know?

487
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:17,368
But I've been smiling like this.

488
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,621
I've always been smiling.

489
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:26,795
Gosh, I'm sorry.

490
00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:31,049
I'm really sorry. I…

491
00:47:31,841 --> 00:47:32,801
So that's why…

492
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,178
Well…

493
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,513
You had no idea.

494
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,183
Sorry to fluster you like this.

495
00:47:40,266 --> 00:47:41,267
I mean…

496
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,395
It's okay.

497
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:48,024
I thought you'd probably say no,
but I just wanted to ask.

498
00:47:48,983 --> 00:47:50,777
It's fine, really.

499
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,364
Take care then. Bye.

500
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,513
That's the signal.

501
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,894
<i>I thought you'd probably say no,
but I just wanted to ask.</i>

502
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:39,022
<i>I'm really sorry. I…</i>

503
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:11,721
You need to pass out! Do it now!

504
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:13,264
He's coming. Hey, he's coming.

505
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:15,433
He's coming. Hurry…

506
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,144
Are you all right?

507
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:22,982
I'm okay.

508
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:25,818
Where…

509
00:50:25,902 --> 00:50:28,404
Are you okay? Let me see.
Is it your wrist?

510
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:29,822
Are you… Let me see.

511
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:36,204
Gi-jeong!

512
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,121
Hey, you idiot.

513
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:57,809
It hurts.

514
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,064
It hurts.

515
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:05,316
No, don't touch me. It hurts.

516
00:51:16,661 --> 00:51:18,830
I said, don't!

517
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:20,414
Where did you fall?

518
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:22,834
On the street! Where else?

519
00:51:25,044 --> 00:51:26,462
It hurts.

520
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,798
Why are you crying?

521
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:32,051
Because it hurts!

522
00:51:32,635 --> 00:51:34,095
Goodness.

523
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,930
My God.

524
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:12,884
Damn it.

525
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:15,928
Gosh.

526
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:15,905
Is there fried shrimp too?

527
00:53:15,988 --> 00:53:17,782
-Who picked this up?
-I did.

528
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,617
-You're the best.
-Is this all?

529
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,370
Come on, Hyeon-a
came all the way here. Jeez.

530
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:24,705
I'm making a fire to cook more food.

531
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:28,918
-It's raining.
-Damn.

532
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:29,961
Shoot.

533
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,505
-Jeez.
-Come on, hurry.

534
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:33,839
What the hell?

535
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,134
-Hurry.
-You want to cover this?

536
00:53:37,218 --> 00:53:38,177
Yes, cover it.

537
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:40,596
It's just a shower. It'll stop soon.

538
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:44,809
-Cover it. Hey, it's pouring.
-Come on now.

539
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,894
It's pouring down.

540
00:53:47,937 --> 00:53:48,980
Damn.

541
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,231
It's out of the blue.

542
00:53:50,982 --> 00:53:52,608
Gosh.

543
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,155
How's Gi-jeong? Is her injury bad?

544
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:02,702
Well, she didn't break her bone.
It's just a crack.

545
00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:03,869
Which hand?

546
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:05,997
Her left hand.

547
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:08,958
That's a relief.

548
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,377
You guys should've rehearsed it.

549
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,088
Hey, I just gave her a little push.

550
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,924
How could I have known
her bag strap would get caught?

551
00:54:17,008 --> 00:54:20,303
I thought,
"Chang-hee must really love her."

552
00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:22,722
"He's determined to make her pass out."

553
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:26,058
Gi-jeong has always been super dramatic.

554
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:27,393
Ever since she was little.

555
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:30,313
When we got into a fight
and I hit her even just a little…

556
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:32,356
She acted like she was dying.

557
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,525
That's why I wasn't worried
about her acting.

558
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,029
She said if I give her a little push,
she'd fall on her own.

559
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:39,280
I thought she would.

560
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:45,036
Amnesia, my ass. If you're embarrassed,
just be embarrassed.

561
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,955
Life is a series of embarrassments anyway.

562
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,291
It's embarrassing
from the moment you're born.

563
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,584
You're born naked.

564
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:54,795
You're right.

565
00:54:56,339 --> 00:54:57,173
It stopped.

566
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:59,425
-Already?
-Yes, it won't rain anymore.

567
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:03,763
Where's Mi-jeong?

568
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:07,600
She's out with her boyfriend.
I wanted to see his face.

569
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:09,143
He's handsome.

570
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:11,520
That's not what I meant.

571
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:13,981
She doesn't even know his name, right?

572
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,650
I know men pretty well.

573
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:20,112
Once I see him, I'll know what kind
of life he's had since childhood.

574
00:55:21,614 --> 00:55:22,615
That's scary.

575
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,619
How many men do you have to date
to reach that level?

576
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:29,872
All men are the same breed.

577
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:33,542
You have a relationship with one
and you know all there is to know.

578
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:36,128
-We're all the same breed?
-Turns out, yes.

579
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:39,215
Hey.

580
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,592
He and I are the same breed?

581
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:44,512
You're all the same breed.

582
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:47,556
I know you want to believe
that you're not, but you are.

583
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,643
Sense of inferiority and superiority,
self-love, and self-hatred.

584
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:53,437
You all have these things,
it's just the percentage that differs.

585
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,355
You all have them.

586
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,857
Every guy I've ever dated had them.

587
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:04,156
Here comes Gi-jeong.

588
00:56:06,992 --> 00:56:09,453
Gosh, I admire you.

589
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:11,872
I mean, you're so cool.

590
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,400
What are you doing here?

591
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:44,321
I came to see Mi-jeong's boyfriend,
but they ran off.

592
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:47,116
You're not here to see me?

593
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,454
That too.

594
00:56:57,001 --> 00:56:59,962
I'm sorry that I'm doing better
than you expected.

595
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,089
Well, let's just say that you're fine.

596
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:04,759
Getting rejected by a guy
and getting a cast isn't so bad.

597
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,891
What happened? You said you'd
pass out and pretend not to remember.

598
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:16,812
Jeez, not anyone can act.

599
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:19,607
I was sitting on the ground,
so how could I pass out, you jerk?

600
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:24,153
It turned out
I still have my quick reflexes.

601
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:26,030
At that moment,

602
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,741
I thought I might get hurt,
so I planted my hand down.

603
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:30,534
My hand moved before I realized it.

604
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,538
Why do I have such good reflexes? Damn it.

605
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:43,088
It was a perfect landing,
so how could I pass out, you idiot?

606
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:46,717
Jeez!

607
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:50,012
I'm an idiot for going there
in the first place.

608
00:57:52,932 --> 00:57:55,267
I don't think there's anything
I can't do now.

609
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:57,978
I'm still growing even at this age.

610
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,692
I'm conquering yet another fear this way.

611
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:05,820
It's no big deal.

612
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:11,534
I can get over this!

613
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:12,868
You can get over this!

614
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,581
It's all your fault, you fool.

615
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,586
Come on! Help me with this!

616
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,629
-The fire!
-The fire.

617
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:26,131
Come on.

618
00:58:26,215 --> 00:58:27,341
Do I have to help?

619
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:28,384
Come!

620
00:58:41,397 --> 00:58:44,984
I'm relieved that you seem better
than I thought.

621
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:56,203
For a while, I couldn't sleep

622
00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:58,998
and had a lot on my mind.

623
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,502
That's over, and I feel relieved now.

624
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:09,216
I feel better.

625
00:59:10,092 --> 00:59:11,427
I should've done this sooner.

626
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,438
It's a rainbow.

627
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:27,568
It's a rainbow!

628
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:53,177
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU
THAT DESPITE YOUR POTENTIAL,

629
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,388
WE CAN NOT OFFER YOU A POSITION
ON THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM

630
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:03,020
Yeom Chang-hee, let's get promoted!

631
01:00:11,779 --> 01:00:13,614
Hey, Yu-rim! Cho Yu-rim!

632
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:31,382
<i>Why do I want to take a picture again?</i>

633
01:01:11,213 --> 01:01:13,007
Sometimes, I have this thought.

634
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:16,301
When you were three,

635
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,512
seven,

636
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,515
and 19 years old…

637
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,310
I wish I could go back in time

638
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,148
and sit quietly next to your younger self.

639
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,365
You're doing that now.

640
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,248
When I'm 90 years old,

641
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,046
this will be my younger self.

642
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:47,154
MY LIBERATION NOTES

643
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,394
Why are you coming from Gu's house?

644
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:50,813
We're dating.

645
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,564
Who says something like that while eating?

646
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,692
<i>But you seem better than I thought.</i>

647
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:56,652
<i>You're amazing.</i>

648
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:01,198
<i>I've looked back on it.
I'll be waiting to hear from you.</i>

649
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,700
<i>I will make her change no matter what.</i>

650
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:05,077
I'll give my all.

651
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,537
Why are you following me around?

652
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,205
Hey, stop! Pull over.

653
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:12,417
<i>It's really you. What are you doing here?</i>

654
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:13,460
But someone died.

655
01:03:15,671 --> 01:03:17,214
<i>I think he got wind of it.</i>

656
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,883
<i>Say what you want to say.</i>

657
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,636
<i>I'll stop if you tell me to.</i>

658
01:03:24,018 --> 01:03:25,898
