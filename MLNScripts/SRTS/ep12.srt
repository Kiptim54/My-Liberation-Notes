3
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:22,108
<i>I'm on my way to church.</i>

4
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,901
CHO TAE-HUN

5
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,988
<i>Okay, have a nice time praying.</i>

6
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,578
<i>Sorry. It's always going
to be like this on Sundays.</i>

7
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:37,957
<i>It's okay.</i>

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,045
<i>I'm just happy to have someone
I can text on Sunday morning like this.</i>

9
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,597
-See you later.
-See you.

10
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,229
Take it easy.

11
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:10,740
Can you wash these already?

12
00:01:18,372 --> 00:01:21,167
Wash and hang the sneakers to dry
while the sun's strong.

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,378
-You told me to do the dishes.
-Are you still not done?

14
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:27,465
I should just break
these damn phones or something.

15
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:34,972
We used to have a goat.

16
00:01:36,682 --> 00:01:37,516
Okay.

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,811
But you feel weirdly sorry
when you raise cows or goats

18
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:43,063
since you're going to eat them eventually.

19
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,651
Goats like humans.

20
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,612
It used to follow me around,

21
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,114
and it made me feel bad.

22
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:54,825
So?

23
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:57,411
Did you eat it?

24
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,497
The one that liked you?

25
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:04,001
We swapped goats with our neighbor.

26
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,716
We usually swap them before we eat them.

27
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:16,430
Do people have to go that far?
I'd rather just not eat it.

28
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,184
Would you throw them out, then?

29
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,063
Can't you just keep raising them?

30
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:27,274
You can't. They eat so much.

31
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,652
They eat nonstop
except when they're asleep.

32
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,238
Dad got too tired to get grass for it,
so we ate it.

33
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:38,744
How could you eat something
you had spent time with and given a name?

34
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:42,164
It didn't have a name.

35
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,254
We don't name the ones we're going to eat.

36
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,304
Hey.

37
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,348
Give me a name already, okay?

38
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,101
Give me a name so you can't eat me.

39
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:04,687
You're Mr. Gu.

40
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,415
Father. I loved today's sermon.

41
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,251
Thank you very much.

42
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,553
-Oh, Yu-rim's here.
-I'll be off then. See you.

43
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:38,554
Goodbye.

44
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,223
What do you want for lunch?

45
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:43,100
Sushi.

46
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:46,854
That's my Yu-rim. Excellent choice.

47
00:03:58,115 --> 00:04:00,326
Put your coat on! The wind is strong.

48
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:02,995
Don't forget the kneepads.

49
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:05,831
I told you to come out,
but here you are, eating <i>ramyeon</i>...

50
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:06,916
Eat this.

51
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:10,586
It's the special, and there's <i>uni,</i> too.
Tae-hun bought it for you.

52
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,726
Watch out for cars.
And pick up a recorder for Yu-rim.

53
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,478
All right. Let's go.

54
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:30,439
Try it out at the shop first!
Don't just get anything.

55
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:31,649
I got it!

56
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:35,361
Son of a...

57
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:37,988
Bastard.

58
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:41,158
Doing anything you want
behind our backs, damn it.

59
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:43,410
Leave him be. Pretend not to know.

60
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,537
This isn't the time for him to be dating.

61
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:49,333
Then, what? Should we tell him to
not see anyone until Yu-rim grows up?

62
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:54,046
Gi-jeong is okay, all right?

63
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:55,839
She wouldn't give him a hard time.

64
00:04:56,465 --> 00:04:58,550
Leave them be. Don't bother him.

65
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:02,554
Do you think Gi-jeong only wants
to date him? At her age?

66
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,227
The three of us can live together
if they get married.

67
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:11,063
Why do we have to sacrifice ourselves?

68
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,023
Then you can move out, too!

69
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:14,775
I can live with Yu-rim.

70
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:21,281
We've lived like
decent human beings all thanks to Yu-rim.

71
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,660
Without Yu-rim, we're nothing.

72
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,790
Thinking of them getting married
and taking Yu-rim away from us...

73
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,126
That makes me even sadder.

74
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:34,878
Life wouldn't be worth living.

75
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,513
Why did you fight with Auntie?

76
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,310
We didn't fight.

77
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:52,646
It's nothing.

78
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,235
Do you like that lady?

79
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,529
Auntie's friend.

80
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:05,826
I know it's very cliché,

81
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,746
but it's the only way
to put it now that I've experienced it.

82
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,252
I feel like I'm flying.

83
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:20,382
I don't think I've ever felt this light.

84
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:22,885
My brother tells me this all the time.

85
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:26,055
The people who don't know me
are the lucky ones.

86
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,265
Since I speak ill of everyone I know.

87
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:32,269
The moment you become someone I know,
I start speaking badly of you.

88
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:36,315
Even if everybody says you're all right,
I still do it somehow.

89
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,152
That must include us.

90
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,403
Many times for me.

91
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,697
Only sometimes for you.

92
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:44,698
Right...

93
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,451
But...

94
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,579
I don't feel like bad-mouthing anyone.

95
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:52,956
Since I've let go of that,

96
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:55,542
I feel lighter than ever before.

97
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:00,422
So that's how heavy hatred is.

98
00:07:00,506 --> 00:07:03,092
I felt like something was
dragging me down to the ground.

99
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,011
But now, I feel like I can even fly.

100
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,599
I'm jealous. I guess
you'll be seeing him every day?

101
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,559
I can't see him often.

102
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,687
We're both so busy.

103
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,398
Still...

104
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,652
just the feeling of having someone

105
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,280
is enough for me.

106
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:31,912
I feel like I'm alone
even though I have someone.

107
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:36,333
And when you know
that you don't have anyone...

108
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,588
We broke up.

109
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,973
Bring me with you.

110
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:57,062
Where is it? Be honest.

111
00:07:57,146 --> 00:07:58,480
I told you yesterday.

112
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,068
Did you have lunch?

113
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:04,653
Yes.

114
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:14,746
You've heard from your sister, right?

115
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:17,875
Yes.

116
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,177
Relax your right hand.

117
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,513
That's it.
Totally relax as it goes out, perfect.

118
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:34,433
Try pushing it through more smoothly.

121
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,942
It's 800.

122
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,194
"Eight hundred."

123
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:47,946
And 1,000.

124
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:51,742
Be sure to get half in advance.

125
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,036
For the cost of the wood.

126
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:57,372
That way, even if they cancel
after we've cut them, we won't lose money.

127
00:08:57,456 --> 00:09:00,918
If they cancel after you cut everything,
you can't even use any of it.

128
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,670
And if possible,
don't take jobs from interior designers.

129
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:07,257
They always say they'll pay you

Is this really the place?

133
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,217
Can I help you?

134
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:53,720
Goodness, nice to meet you.

135
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:58,183
Do you know where I can find
the people who work here?

136
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:21,832
These three siblings are all
so good-looking.

137
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,253
But it looks like none of them
have gotten married yet?

138
00:10:27,546 --> 00:10:29,089
There aren't any wedding photos.

139
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:31,717
No, they haven't. I'm sick of them.

140
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,611
Here they are now.

141
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,014
Do we have a guest?

142
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,683
Hello.

143
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:22,809
Yes, hi. Who...

144
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,228
He says he's Mr. Gu's friend.

145
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:28,148
He couldn't reach him,
so he came to check on him.

146
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,358
-Goodness, is that so?
-It's nice to meet you.

147
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:31,902
-Nice to meet you, yes.
-Yes.

148
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:33,028
Nice to...

149
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:37,657
Please, have a seat. Please come.

150
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,036
God, I've been waiting for so long.
I'm so hungry!

151
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,165
Hurry up and sit.

152
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:56,718
I was worried he might get drunk and hurt

153
00:11:56,802 --> 00:11:58,637
Why didn't you answer my calls?

154
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,180
Jesus Christ.

155
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:03,725
I get why he wants to stay here, though.

156
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,685
I want to stay, too.

157
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,193
Well, I might be the older one,

158
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,403
but I can only make ends meet
thanks to him.

159
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,157
He's at the top, you know.
Everyone's beneath him.

160
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:22,828
You must be famished. Help yourself.

161
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,371
-Thanks.
-Please.

162
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,623
Yes, well, thank you for the food.

163
00:12:27,374 --> 00:12:29,126
Let's see...

164
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,802
Let me offer you a drink. Honey.

165
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,011
I'm fine, thank you.

166
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:42,514
I brought my car.

167
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:44,474
Right...

168
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,103
-This is delicious.
-Please, help yourself.

169
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,950
What on earth are you doing here?

170
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:07,038
Is it fun? Living a lie?

171
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,376
Enough with the show, punk.

172
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,420
Carpentry just doesn't suit you.

173
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,592
Think about all the people
who rely on you, you bastard.

174
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,844
Our boys are all in ruin now.

175
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:23,430
Seung-jae works at the host bar.

176
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:26,349
Yeong-il works in a kitchen.
They're telling me to be a waiter!

177
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:30,604
We only used to be somebodies
because you were there with you.

178
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,482
Have we ever been capable
of doing anything by ourselves?

179
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,156
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:45,494
I'm depending too much on you
even though I'm older.

181
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:53,168
Hey, you should've come back
when Chairman Shin told you to.

182
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:56,713
Why did you make him upset?
He came all the way here for you!

183
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,051
Forget about Baek trying to kill you.

184
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,886
It'll be Chairman Shin now.

185
00:14:06,014 --> 00:14:08,433
You have a girl here, don't you?

186
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:16,566
You do?

187
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,945
You do, you bastard.

188
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,828
Oh, my God.

189
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,248
Someone joined the Liberation Club.

190
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:57,667
Have a look, see who it is.

191
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:05,925
MY LIBERATION NOTES

192
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,510
SO HYANG-GI

193
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:12,641
Since I sat in on the meeting that day,
I've wanted to join all along.

194
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,436
I finally got up the courage to do it.

195
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:21,858
There are more than a few things
I want to be liberated from, but first...

196
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,779
This expression...

197
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,740
I can't stop making this expression.

198
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:33,828
When I see someone in front of me,

199
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:37,457
my face automatically makes
this expression.

200
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,543
Even though I'm not happy at all.

201
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,507
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I was unhappy,

202
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,428
but I'm not happy enough
to smile like this.

203
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,181
When I see someone,

204
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,976
I automatically make this expression.

205
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:58,937
So...

206
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,400
it's really difficult for me
to attend funerals.

207
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,198
Every time I go to a funeral,

208
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:13,493
I try to force myself
to put on a neutral expression...

209
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:19,999
but it's so hard.

210
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:26,131
Welcome.

211
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,718
First, let me tell you
the Liberation Club's rules--

212
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,136
Yes, I know.

213
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,264
"Do not give advice,
and do not try to comfort."

214
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:35,765
That's a sub-rule.

215
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,602
Go ahead and explain.

216
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,857
Since the purpose of this club
is to become happier,

217
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,361
we've made three tenets

218
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,655
in order to take
an honest look into our lives.

219
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:52,741
I see.

220
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,786
"One. I will not pretend to be happy."

221
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,998
All right.

222
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,834
It applies to me perfectly.

223
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,212
"I will not pretend to be happy."

224
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,300
"Two. I will not pretend to be unhappy."

225
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,348
"Three. I will be honest."

226
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,771
I wonder why...

227
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,316
I feel so afraid

228
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,735
of being honest?

229
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,781
Just be honest with yourself.

230
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:34,365
On the inside.

231
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,409
I see.

232
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:38,995
Gosh, that scared me.

233
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,706
I was so scared,
I almost quit immediately.

234
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,675
<i>Shall I buy cheese or jerky?</i>

235
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:54,844
<i>I just bought both.</i>

236
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:00,600
MR. GU
CALL

237
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:14,447
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

238
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:29,712
It's Yeom Mi-jeong!

239
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:41,808
I thought that lady was genuinely
a really happy person.

240
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,853
I guess everyone is just pretending.

241
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,815
Does anyone live without pretending?

242
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:51,860
Do you pretend, too?

243
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:54,654
All the time.

244
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,574
Don't you?

245
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,202
Of course I do.

246
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,204
I pretend to be easygoing.

247
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,502
If you think about it another way,

248
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:13,965
it's because everyone is pretending
that life on Earth flows so smoothly.

249
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,803
If I lived today
without pretending at all,

250
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,183
I would've killed and eaten someone.

251
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:34,652
It's weird, but when I see something cute,
I get the urge to squeeze it and eat it.

252
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,862
In one bite.

253
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:49,125
You just tell me anything you want now.

254
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:14,108
Ms. Jeong's dad is still better than her.

255
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:17,487
He's annoying, but he doesn't
turn you inside out or anything.

256
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,282
Ms. Jeong badmouths someone
I don't even know for an hour

257
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:24,744
and tells me that I'm like them,
after cursing them out for an hour.

258
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:30,333
Why does it feel like the effect
of the car is slowly wearing off?

259
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:35,213
In my opinion, getting a girlfriend
would be more effective.

260
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:38,508
I said get a girlfriend.
I didn't say get marriage.

261
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,593
What's wrong, married man?

262
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:45,932
I really love Sang-ji.

263
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,101
I love her like crazy. But...

264
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,436
It's hard.

265
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,230
Da-yeon!

266
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:53,648
It's been ages.

267
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,316
Did you just get off?

268
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,443
-Yes.
-I thought you said you couldn't come?

269
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:02,073
Well, I was going to go home
then heard Chang-hee was here.

270
00:22:11,082 --> 00:22:15,169
Hey, what's wrong? She's being
very forward. Why are you ignoring it?

271
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,046
What do you mean, "forward"?

272
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,757
How much more obvious can it be?

273
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:25,972
What's with him?

274
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:32,353
When you're finally done
with your education, job-hunting,

275
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:34,313
having kids, and raising them,

276
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:36,357
you move on to their education,
job-hunting,

277
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:39,068
and raising children,
all over again, you know?

278
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,281
A man and woman meeting
and falling in love should be the end.

279
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:45,950
It should stop there.

280
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:49,287
But saying, "Let's not have kids,"

281
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,624
sounds super cold, like you're saying,
"I don't love you that much."

282
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,668
That's why people can't say it.

283
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:59,547
So they end up opening the door
to a lifetime of hardship

284
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,382
and cause another person

285
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:03,551
to suffer.

286
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:10,057
So, how do we explain nicely to women

287
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:14,645
that not wanting to
have children with them

288
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:19,066
doesn't mean you don't love them?

289
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,194
Chang-hee. How?

290
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,238
Did you understand?

291
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:34,081
Hey, you guys had this kind of vibe
last time, too. Are you still there?

292
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,876
What's going on with you two?

293
00:23:39,045 --> 00:23:40,213
Should I

294
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:42,840
give you a ride home tonight?

295
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,726
Stop it.

296
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:57,897
Hey.

297
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,651
Hey, he's offering you a ride home.
You can't eat the squid...

298
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:05,738
Have some fruit, all right? It's sweet.

299
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:11,452
-Bye!
-Bye!

300
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:12,787
-Take care.
-Yes.

301
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,913
-See you.
-Go.

302
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,082
Gosh...

303
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,836
Hey!

304
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,128
Off you go.

305
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,047
Good luck.

306
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,640
Aren't they picking up?

307
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,229
Give me a sec. Stay here.

308
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,442
Excuse me, is the owner
of car number 6145 here?

309
00:24:43,526 --> 00:24:47,321
Is the owner of car number 6145 here?

310
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,058
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:19,770
What for? You can just
give me a ride next time.

312
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,526
It's here.

313
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,070
-I'll see you, then.
-Yes.

314
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:31,449
Don't fight with them.

315
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,701
Get home safe.

316
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,621
Good night.

317
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,414
Good night.

318
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,101
Excuse me

319
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:00,978
Yes?

320
00:26:01,062 --> 00:26:04,106
How could you not answer your phone
after parking like this?

321
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,776
But I didn't get any calls.

322
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:09,195
What do you mean?
I called you so many times.

323
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,113
I didn't receive any.

324
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,574
Look. I didn't.

325
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,911
Look at this. See how many times
I called you.

326
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,333
You've got the number wrong.

327
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,502
It's eight, not zero.

328
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,843
And you must've kept pressing redial.

329
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:35,763
Why would I not answer my phone
when I parked my car here?

330
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:40,017
I thought it was odd that no one
asked me to move my car.

331
00:26:40,977 --> 00:26:42,103
Then...

332
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,480
you should have come check.

333
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:09,964
"How to date
a woman who lives in Gyeonggi."

334
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,591
Never give me a ride home.

335
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,678
It will take forever for you to get back.

336
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,972
You'll think you won't do it ever again.

337
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:21,684
But if you do it once
and never do it again,

338
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:25,896
it'll feel like I did something wrong
and I'll feel sad.

339
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,399
So, just never give me a ride
from the beginning.

340
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:34,363
When someone offers sometimes,
I say no and run away.

341
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:39,035
Even when the subway has closed,
I say it's still running and run away.

342
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:45,291
All right.

343
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:51,464
Now, please teach me
how to date a guy who has a child.

344
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:02,308
It's okay. I should know.

345
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:11,442
On holidays like Christmas
and New Year's Day,

346
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,695
we won't be able to spend time together.

347
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:18,991
Right.

348
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,038
Since you have to be alone
on the days you should spend time

349
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,956
with the person you like,

350
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,001
you'll become dispirited.

351
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:34,715
I get what you're trying to say.

352
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:40,429
Well, I'm not really the type
to place a lot of importance

353
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:42,556
on days like Valentine's Day or whatever.

354
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,018
And what else?

355
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:49,522
Well, the other things are

356
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,316
just things that you would expect.

357
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,360
I'll be busy,

358
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:57,113
many unexpected things will crop up,

359
00:28:57,196 --> 00:29:00,783
and I might even cancel
our plans sometimes.

360
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:05,371
Don't hesitate for even a second,
and just call me right away

361
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:08,499
and cancel them. No apologies.

362
00:29:14,004 --> 00:29:15,506
<i>Do you like that lady?</i>

363
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:18,467
Auntie's friend.

364
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,264
Why do you like her?

365
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:33,649
She lets me...

366
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:36,944
relax.

367
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,488
Catch your breath, just for a minute.

368
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,869
<i>I don't have to be</i>

369
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,289
super energetic and fun.

370
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:52,418
That's why.

371
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:03,262
You know that I'm...

372
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,056
not that fun.

373
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:11,312
That's good.

374
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,117
I'll give you a ride today.

375
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,620
It's fine, I told you earlier.

376
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,121
I'm okay. I'll be off, then.

377
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:31,415
I really want to give you a ride.

378
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:32,333
Get in, please.

379
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,001
I can just take the train.

380
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,420
Why would you drive that far?
I'm off, all right?

381
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:38,339
Really, I want to give you a ride.

382
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,300
No! You should go home.
I'll see you. Good night.

383
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:49,475
You idiot.

384
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,478
Where else are you going to kiss him?

385
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,064
Damn it.

386
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,858
He probably meant to kiss me tonight.

387
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,334
Let's sleep together next time!

388
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:38,440
ALPHA RETAIL

389
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:53,205
I mean, why does an HQ employee
have to apologize for this?

390
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:55,874
Did I sigh?
It was the store owner who sighed.

391
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,711
I mean, I'm so busy right now.

392
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,964
It's annoying enough that this crazy guy
paid for a pack of cigarettes

393
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,299
with 10 and 100 won coins.

394
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,466
But the store owner

395
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,720
counted all the coins and sighed
while other customers watched.

396
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,180
Isn't that also being an asshole?
At that busy time?

397
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,683
Seriously.

398
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,143
God damn it!

399
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,646
Why does he want
to get an apology from me?

400
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,733
I have nothing to do with it!

401
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,192
That's enough.

402
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,236
I mean, think about it.

403
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,905
Why do we have to
apologize for things that happen

404
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,033
between the store owner and a customer?

405
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,659
Don't you agree, Mr. Yeom?

406
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:34,163
Chang-hee! Let's go for a drive
together later, all right?

407
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:36,999
I need to visit the Gangdong branch later.
Is that okay?

408
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:39,835
Seriously.

409
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,981
-What about that place yesterday?
-I said it wasn't there.

410
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,317
There was a car blocking this car.

411
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,987
-Hello, yes, hi.
-Here.

412
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:08,864
This is my colleague's car...

413
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,699
Looks like you've made it big.

414
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:12,451
No. Just take a look.

415
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,579
Oh, dear.

416
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:17,206
Oh, dear.

417
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,294
When did it happen?

418
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:24,088
He doesn't know.

419
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,757
He says it was like this
when he came to work today.

420
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,885
And the car dashcam
doesn't have a memory chip in it.

421
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:34,723
Wouldn't this kind of car
have more than just a dashcam?

422
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:36,433
Of course not.

423
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,562
From the location of the scratch,
it must have been a sedan...

424
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:42,439
And it's silver.

425
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:43,865
Pearl silver.

426
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:51,699
First, you need to remember
the places you parked in

427
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,701
and go through the CCTV footage.

428
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,495
If you report it to the police,
they'll show you.

429
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,872
There's one place I'm thinking of.

430
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,083
The place we parked yesterday afternoon.

431
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,210
But they don't have any CCTV.

432
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:05,754
Gosh, you guys just have no luck.

433
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:11,802
Then what do we do?

434
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:12,720
Right.

435
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,347
We need to ask people
who parked there yesterday

436
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:18,016
if we could see their dashcam footage.

437
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,685
How will we find those people?

438
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:22,521
So, you need to go there right now

439
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:26,233
and ask all the people
who have parked there one by one.

440
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:29,278
"Did you park your car here
yesterday afternoon too?"

441
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:33,157
And if you find anyone, then you
should ask them to show you the footage.

442
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,161
You'll have to hurry up.

443
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,079
Dashcam footage only lasts for one day.

444
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:39,997
One day?

445
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,884
Aren't you supposed to look around
the car every time you get in and out?

446
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,093
It's a luxury car.

447
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,220
I did, at first!

448
00:34:58,474 --> 00:35:00,726
The company is holding a design contest.

449
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,855
The winner should come from
the design department, shouldn't it?

450
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:09,276
I'll be really embarrassed if
another department wins it this time, too.

451
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:10,903
Kim Ji-hui.

452
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:12,988
Yes, sir.

453
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:14,323
Han Su-jin.

454
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:15,949
Yes, sir.

455
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:17,743
Pay extra attention to it.

456
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,496
Show me what you're made of.

457
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:25,459
The prize money and evaluation merits
are worth putting in the effort for, no?

458
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,725
What an asshole. Leaving out us temps...

459
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,729
Mi-jeong, you should win it
and get a permanent position.

460
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:49,107
Don't you have to leave the company
if you don't get it this year?

461
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,277
They wouldn't fire an employee
who's won the design contest.

462
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:57,074
You should pull all-nighters to win.

463
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,034
And I'll win next year.

464
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,530
Gosh. Goodness me.

465
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,074
-What is it now?
-Gosh.

466
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:50,419
HYE-SUK

467
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:54,298
Gosh, he left his phone at home!

468
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,717
Call Chang-hee and ask him where he is.

469
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,719
Tell him to pick up some dried pollack.

470
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,016
BRUSH PEN

471
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,475
Yes, thank you.

472
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:09,897
WHOLESALE STATIONERY

473
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:55,359
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO REPLACE
THE BUMPER OF A ROLLS GHOST?

474
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:58,737
AROUND 20-30 MILLION WON.

475
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:50,122
WE PREPARED THIS PLACE
FOR YOUR SPIRIT, FATHER.

476
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:18,942
Tell Mr. Gu to come over and have a drink.

477
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:32,914
How much did you pay to rent that car?

478
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:42,007
The car in front of Du-hwan's café.
How much did you pay to rent it?

479
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,219
What do you mean "rent"?

480
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,139
I didn't lease it. It's a friend's.

481
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:51,016
Which friend?

482
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,771
Do you know all of my friends, Dad?
Just one of them.

483
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,649
Which friend?

484
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:11,703
Gu.

485
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,921
That's right, Gu's superrich.

486
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,633
He lent it to me to drive around.

487
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:35,227
Mi-jeong's so lucky, Dad.
She's hit the jackpot.

488
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:53,495
Dont drive other people's cars.

489
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:05,924
We eat with him under one roof.
Isn't he practically family?

490
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:08,635
I'll never drive a car like that again.

491
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:10,720
Can't I just enjoy this moment?

492
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:15,183
It's like you hate that I'm happy.

493
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,310
Why would you drive someone else's car?

494
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:19,396
Such an expensive car, at that.

495
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,908
Just say, "I understand,"
and drive it in secret, you dumbass.

496
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:35,162
Mr. Gu is on his way, stop it.

497
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:37,664
Mr. Gu is coming.

498
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,462
Come have a seat, all right?

499
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:54,806
Here.

500
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:34,930
What are you doing?

501
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:36,973
What?

502
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,725
I'll eat somewhere else.

503
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,685
Just eat here.

504
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:13,385
Stop trying to fix it on your own.

505
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:14,719
Just tell him the truth.

506
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,641
Just tell Mr. Gu the truth
and get hit a few times.

507
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:20,892
And use the insurance.

508
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,979
He definitely has insurance
on the car. I'm sure.

509
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,647
He owns it, doesn't he?

510
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:23,496
Hello...

511
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:22,806
<i>What would be better?</i>

512
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:26,226
<i>Would it be better to just get o
n my knees here and spare Gu the trouble?</i>

513
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:30,230
<i>Or should I make him
too exhausted to even hit me?</i>

514
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:35,026
<i>But would he ever
get too exhausted to hit me?</i>

515
00:45:57,465 --> 00:46:00,635
<i>You are like...</i>

516
00:46:00,718 --> 00:46:02,178
<i>Stop! I'm the only one
who needs to understand me.</i>

517
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:04,055
<i>You don't need to act like you know me.</i>

518
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:10,603
<i>You're rough and transparent.</i>

519
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:12,522
<i>You're crazy.</i>

520
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,192
You're transparent.

521
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,076
Mr. Gu!

522
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:26,870
Mr. Gu!

523
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:29,414
Here.

524
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,220
Hey, Chang-hee! Here!

525
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,520
<i>Nothing goes my way.</i>

526
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:57,233
I once read a book about how to
be a good writer to become a writer,

527
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,319
and it said that a good drama is

528
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:02,197
one where the main character
tries hard to achieve something

529
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,114
but can't do it.

530
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:05,074
<i>So I gave up.</i>

531
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:08,703
<i>Why would I write something
that's like life? It's so boring.</i>

532
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,219
<i>He says he wants to meet you.</i>

533
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:27,597
Since I told him about you all the time.

534
00:50:31,886 --> 00:50:33,637
Look who's here.

535
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:40,186
You came all the way here?
What's gotten into you?

536
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:49,195
When I was running the club,

537
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:54,116
we had this guy who was super unpopular.

538
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,746
I got why he was unpopular, that punk.

539
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:01,707
He had no charm.

540
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,170
I mean, everyone has

541
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:09,590
their own charm.

542
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:16,430
He would lie or brag all the time.

543
00:51:16,514 --> 00:51:18,516
So I really laid into him.

544
00:51:20,768 --> 00:51:23,938
I wondered if he would have quit,
but he still works in this field.

545
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:28,317
So I thought, "How the hell
did that asshole survive?"

546
00:51:29,693 --> 00:51:31,362
It turned out he became a dealer.

547
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:42,915
He sells drugs.

548
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:49,839
And I saw him
at Baek's place a few days ago.

549
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,684
Baek, that bastard is selling drugs.

550
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,192
I'll attack Baek then!

551
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:12,236
I'm going to trust you, okay?

552
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,657
I'm telling Chairman Shin
that you're coming back!

553
00:52:40,973 --> 00:52:43,267
Now I can understand her.

554
00:52:46,187 --> 00:52:48,105
What do you mean?

555
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,733
He's not in the office.

556
00:53:32,816 --> 00:53:34,235
Of course not. I told you.

557
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:40,699
Hey, block the exits
and search in groups of two!

558
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:42,159
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go.

559
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:02,221
You bastard.
So are you going to come up here?

560
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,431
<i>Get up here and try me, you bastard!</i>

561
00:54:04,932 --> 00:54:07,643
<i>This is why I don't trust bastards
who worked in host bars.</i>

562
00:54:07,726 --> 00:54:10,813
You bastards don't know how to play fair.

563
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,774
<i>You acted like you would
come fight me in person.</i>

564
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:15,609
But you just ratted me out.

565
00:54:15,693 --> 00:54:18,279
You just wait there for me,
you son of a bitch.

566
00:54:18,362 --> 00:54:19,947
I'll go to Sanpo right now.

567
00:55:09,413 --> 00:55:10,706
I've decided to leave.

568
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:16,587
Where will you go?

569
00:55:19,923 --> 00:55:20,883
To Seoul.

570
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:26,764
Why all of a sudden?

571
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,228
It just happened.

572
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:40,194
SANPO SINKS, CLOSETS
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

573
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:11,869
I'll call you sometimes.

574
00:57:12,786 --> 00:57:15,164
Let's meet once a month,
or once every two months.

575
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,585
What for?

576
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:28,218
I want to live a clear-cut life.

577
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,264
I'm sure you roughly know

578
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:34,808
what kind of life I led until now.

579
00:57:36,727 --> 00:57:38,353
This world is this world,

580
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,482
and that world is that world.

581
00:57:43,317 --> 00:57:45,861
I told you, I don't care
what kind of life you've led.

582
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:48,363
You don't care what kind of life I've led?

583
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:53,368
What about the kind of life I'll live?

584
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,249
I'm just fine

585
00:58:00,793 --> 00:58:01,835
with my life.

586
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:13,055
Curse me out if you want.

587
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,266
Don't regret it later.

588
00:58:25,484 --> 00:58:26,318
Go ahead.

589
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,493
Aren't you angry?

590
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:39,748
I'm...

591
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:42,835
You're what?

592
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:46,171
Say it.

593
00:58:48,924 --> 00:58:49,967
I'm...

594
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:54,263
not angry.

595
00:58:57,224 --> 00:58:59,309
I'm quitting and leaving,
but you're not angry?

596
00:59:02,437 --> 00:59:04,106
You want to go back.

597
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:07,651
You want to leave,

598
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,947
and I could tell you not to...

599
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,702
or I could ask you to stay longer.

600
00:59:24,001 --> 00:59:25,043
I'm just sad.

601
00:59:26,837 --> 00:59:28,130
But I'm not angry.

602
00:59:30,174 --> 00:59:32,134
I don't know, I might be angry later.

603
00:59:48,317 --> 00:59:49,610
You too.

604
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:53,989
Live in Seoul if possible, all right?

605
00:59:56,533 --> 00:59:57,701
Like an ordinary person.

606
00:59:58,994 --> 01:00:00,120
Surrounded by people.

607
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:02,748
I'm ordinary now, too.

608
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:04,499
Exhaustingly ordinary.

609
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,834
Being ordinary...

610
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:10,923
is when you have common desires.

611
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,259
That's when you can say you're ordinary.

612
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:16,845
Not "worship" or "liberation."

613
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:18,889
The desires that everyone else has.

614
01:00:20,307 --> 01:00:23,977
As your brother said, like the women
who have the strollers they want.

615
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:28,273
I'm going to carry my kid.

616
01:00:32,986 --> 01:00:34,613
I want to carry you.

617
01:00:35,405 --> 01:00:36,949
I want to carry you

618
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,493
at one year old.

619
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:44,456
That's why you live like this.

620
01:00:45,749 --> 01:00:47,584
I'm going to live like this.

621
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,756
I'm just going to live like this.

622
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:02,599
I'm going to call.

623
01:01:03,934 --> 01:01:05,435
Even if you answer grumpily.

624
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:12,234
But not often.

625
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:31,461
SANPO SINKS

626
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:47,811
If you ever change your mind,
you're always welcome here.

2019 MONTHLY SCHEDULE

628
01:02:06,663 --> 01:02:08,915
SANPO CITY
OFFICIAL DUTIES

629
01:02:55,087 --> 01:02:56,088
What's wrong?

630
01:03:00,926 --> 01:03:02,094
Hello.

631
01:03:02,177 --> 01:03:05,138
This is Officer Yeo Min-gu.
Please send an ambulance.

632
01:03:11,561 --> 01:03:13,605
Shit.

633
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:44,886
<i>The number you have dialed
is not in the directory.</i>

634
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,930
<i>Check the number and please try again.</i>

635
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,929
<i>The number you have dialed
is not in the directory.</i>

636
01:03:50,004 --> 01:03:52,711
<i>Please check the number and call again.</i>

637
01:05:14,768 --> 01:05:17,437
Did you miss me?

638
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:20,232
You, punk.

639
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:23,527
Watch your expression
in front of the boys.

640
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:25,862
Why?

641
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:27,572
Did someone die?

642
01:05:31,618 --> 01:05:32,702
Someone did.

643
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:35,372
Someone did die.

644
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:07,654
Me...

645
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:13,285
I'm the kind of person
who's happy when someone dies.

646

"I will not pretend to be happy."

<i>I hoped every man
who ever left me would be unhappy.</i>

651
01:06:47,986 --> 01:06:51,406
<i>As if I wanted all the people who
saw how small I was</i>

01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:59,581
<i>For you, I'm going to hope
that you never even catch a cold.</i>

<i>I'm going to hope that you don't suffer
a single day of being hungover.</i>

afraid of being happy.</i>

659
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:04,854
<i>Why did he leave in such a hurry?
He should've said goodbye.</i>

660
01:08:06,106 --> 01:08:07,399
We're just dating.

661
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:09,776
<i>I'll just stop by and take a look.</i>

662
01:08:10,777 --> 01:08:11,986
<i>Don't let Hyeon-a go.</i>

663
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,405
<i>It's not like we dated.</i>

664

01:08:20,203 --> 01:08:23,790
Yeom Mi-jeong is moving in
for the final blow.

668

<i>I want to be in a really good mood,</i>

669
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,462
<i>but I have no idea what I should do.</i>

670
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:31,339
<i>Come for me.</i>

671
