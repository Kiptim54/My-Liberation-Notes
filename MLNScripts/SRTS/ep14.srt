MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,085
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:15,860
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:53,323
Mom…

6
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,873
They say you can't choose to die
peacefully in your sleep

7
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:03,541
no matter how rich you are.

8
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:07,754
And Hye-suk managed to do it.

9
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,882
It's because this family
has such good luck.

10
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:15,345
Mom, Dad, and even the daughter-in-law
all passed away in their sleep.

11
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,808
That's my dream, too, you know?

12
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:22,018
I feel so bad for my brother.

13
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,728
Je-ho!

14
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:27,565
-I'm so sorry.
-Mom.

15
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,818
Mom…

16
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,532
My poor brother.

17
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:47,877
CREMATORIUM

18
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:11,401
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

19
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,869
When I end up lying there…

20
00:02:23,163 --> 00:02:24,247
who do you think…

21
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,625
will be standing here?

22
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,798
Probably me.

23
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:38,511
Let's…

24
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,058
get married.

25
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,030
It seems like an artificial joint.
What do you want to do with it?

26
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,869
How does this work?

27
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,872
Well, if you want us to discard it,
we can.

28
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,336
Pack it up, please.

29
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,036
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

30
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:05,098
Get some sleep, Dad.

31
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,610
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

32
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:50,638
SANPO SINKS

33
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,615
I'll do some grocery shopping tomorrow.

34
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,285
Just have them delivered.

35
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,370
I did that, too.

36
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,612
It's gone bad.

37
00:09:41,225 --> 00:09:43,686
I'm not having breakfast, don't bother.

38
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,902
I'm off.

39
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,821
Have a fried egg at least!

40
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:55,406
See you tonight.

41
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:57,450
Damn it.

42
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:24,310
{\an8}SANPO CITY

43
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,318
{\an8}The bus is here.

44
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,542
{\an8}It's my treat today.

45
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,753
{\an8}Why would you treat us? It's fine.

46
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,465
{\an8}I should since you came all the way
to the funeral.

47
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,971
{\an8}Mi-jeong, I didn't know you lived
that far away. It took forever.

48
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,890
{\an8}It's 29 stops. I counted it myself.

49
00:11:03,516 --> 00:11:05,434
{\an8}How do you commute from there every day?

50
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,355
{\an8}Where did you put your mom's urn?

51
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:11,732
{\an8}At home.

52
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:17,280
{\an8}Her urn is at your house?

53
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,158
{\an8}Is that okay?

54
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:23,911
{\an8}Why wouldn't it be?

55
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:25,997
{\an8}Isn't it illegal?

56
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,623
{\an8}No, it isn't.

57
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:28,958
{\an8}I see.

58
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,835
{\an8}I heard it was illegal to scatter them.

59
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:35,006
{\an8}Aren't the urns also managed
in some system or something?

60
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,301
What do you think dying is?
It means you're out of the system.

61
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:43,222
Why not a columbarium?

62
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,227
How could we leave her somewhere else?

63
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,566
So it's okay to keep it at home.

64
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,902
Isn't it scary?

65
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:07,371
It still doesn't feel real, does it?

66
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,544
I still don't know what's going on.

67
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:17,089
The ambulance came that day

68
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,135
and said they don't move patients
who are in cardiac arrest.

69
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,681
We asked them desperately
to take her to the hospital,

70
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:27,975
but they said they couldn't.

71
00:12:30,978 --> 00:12:34,106
Then the police came
to see my mom lying in the bedroom.

72
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:37,234
They asked weird things like,

73
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:40,237
"Did you have a fight?"
"How many insurance policies do you have?"

74
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:45,743
That's a really odd experience.

75
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,570
AUNTIE X

76
00:14:51,452 --> 00:14:52,328
Hello?

77
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:55,164
<i>Why didn't you pick up?
I've been calling you since before.</i>

78
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,625
I was busy.

79
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,045
<i>I fried some anchovies and shrimp.
Pick them up when you finish work.</i>

80
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:03,130
Dad doesn't like dry dishes.

81
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:07,218
<i>Hey, your father's a widower now.
Tell him to eat whatever's offered.</i>

82
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,469
<i>Just come and take them.</i>

83
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,098
This damn…

84
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:35,788
Welcome.

85
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,834
I'll have 300g of beef for soup
and 2.4kg of pork ribs.

86
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,795
I see. 300g of beef for soup
and 2.4kg of pork ribs.

87
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:46,465
Actually, make it 3kg.

88
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,300
-3kg of pork ribs, right?
-Yes, please.

89
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,385
Coming right up.

90
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:06,277
Why didn't you just take a taxi?

91
00:16:10,197 --> 00:16:11,532
We're home.

92
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:12,491
We're home.

93
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:35,389
Damn it.

94
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:05,002
Hey, Mom definitely died from overwork.

95
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:17,640
Why do I have to go all the way
to Wangsimni to pick up some food?

96
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,769
She doesn't even know what you like.
She just pretends to care.

97
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,563
I almost threw them out on my way home.

98
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:25,689
That's enough.

99
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:29,318
I know she doesn't care about you.
Why does she have to pretend she does?

100
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,824
She must be doing this
to get money from you.

101
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:39,161
If she even talks about it,
I'll go show her what's what.

102
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,665
-There's nothing stopping me now.
-Seriously…

103
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:46,293
Don't you know
who put Mom through all that?

104
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:50,422
Just let Dad eat!

105
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,553
Give me your seal later, Dad.

106
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:59,056
We'll go and bury it somewhere.

107
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:04,645
If you let your sister
have her way again, we're done.

108
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:08,482
I don't even care if we're family.
I won't see you again!

109
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,121
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

110
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,692
Thank you.

111
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,736
-Thank you, boss.
-Goodbye.

112
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,487
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

113
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:56,864
I had a great time.

114
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:02,161
How's Gi-jeong doing?

115
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,039
I mean, she used to come every day.

116
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:07,624
I kind of miss her.

117
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,252
She goes straight home
after work these days.

118
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,089
Yes, she should.
Her father must be lonely by himself.

119
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,091
He's not alone.

120
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:18,719
I heard her brother quit his job
and stays at home.

121
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,474
Goodness, it's a pity
she passed away so soon.

122
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,893
You didn't even get to meet her.

123
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:27,519
I did.

124
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,318
The day she passed away.

125
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,236
In the afternoon.

126
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:38,989
She bought me lunch.

127
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:49,625
To think that someone I saw
in the afternoon passed in the evening…

128
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,300
She must have wanted
to meet her son-in-law before she left.

129
00:20:12,272 --> 00:20:14,149
{\an8}How could you say that in front of her?

130
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:22,157
{\an8}So I looked at the envelope,

131
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:25,411
{\an8}and it said "Park Jin-u."

132
00:20:27,287 --> 00:20:30,541
{\an8}So I was like, "What?" And I looked up.

133
00:20:30,624 --> 00:20:33,585
{\an8}And he said, "Ms. Yeom Gi-jeong
bad-mouthed me a lot, didn't she?"

134
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:41,218
{\an8}All the people I've heard so much
about were gathered there,

135
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:44,513
{\an8}so I kind of got excited
and put my foot in my mouth.

136
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:49,351
{\an8}I was like,
"So this is what a funeral can be like."

137
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:50,644
{\an8}I told you, right?

138
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:55,983
{\an8}That the girl Gi-jeong said had "nasty"
written all over her face must be pretty.

139
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:00,612
{\an8}I picked her out immediately among
all her colleagues. "It's her!"

140
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,614
{\an8}So I asked Gi-jeong,

141
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:07,411
"The girl who has 'nasty' written
all over her face. That's her, right?"

142
00:21:07,494 --> 00:21:08,537
And she said,

143
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,039
"Yes."

144
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:15,419
It came out that she lied, you know?

145
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:32,352
I was even more shocked
when your mom passed away

146
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:35,731
than when my mom passed away.

147
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,443
Maybe because
I didn't see it coming at all.

148
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,864
It's natural that you come and you go.

149
00:21:45,157 --> 00:21:49,411
But I wish everyone could leave
at the right time.

150
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,165
When is the right time?

151
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:56,627
At 80 years old?

152
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:01,256
You'll feel different when you become 80.

153
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,052
My grandpa used to look
at old people and say

154
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,596
he didn't want to live that long.

155
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,473
He would only live till 80.

156
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:11,475
But when he turned 80,

157
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,646
I asked, "Grandpa, aren't you supposed
to pass away this year?"

158
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:16,647
Then he said,

159
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:19,233
"I don't think so."

160
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:26,114
Just like that,
he managed to live until he was 90.

161
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:29,201
And he still said it wasn't time yet.

162
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,037
What if we have a system

163
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,792
where all humans live up to 100?

164
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,003
And die when they turn 100?

165
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:43,215
Then I'll form a militia when I'm 99.

166
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:45,092
"Destroy the system!"

167
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:48,679
I'll run from the system
into the mountains.

168
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:00,857
There's no such thing as the right time.

169
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:04,653
But your mother chose a good day.

170
00:23:05,237 --> 00:23:06,446
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

171
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,825
We got three days off thanks to your mom.

172
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,703
Gi-jeong and her boyfriend, too.

173
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:16,373
No matter how you look at it,

174
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,127
Gi-jeong's the luckiest one here, right?

175
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,503
Listen.

176
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,299
It would have been shameless
if she was looking for a guy to date

177
00:23:25,382 --> 00:23:27,175
after her mother passed away.

178
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:31,680
But it's as if she knew
something like this was going to happen.

179
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,307
It was as if she was possessed.

180
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,808
Can you believe her?

181
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:39,271
Pretending to have lost
her memories after getting rejected.

182
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:43,775
She was so desperate.
She grabbed onto him in such a hurry.

183
00:23:45,736 --> 00:23:48,405
And then her mom passed away.

184
00:23:51,491 --> 00:23:53,577
So now,

185
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,999
she would be blameless
if she decided to move out.

186
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,626
I can feel it.

187
00:24:03,128 --> 00:24:04,963
Gi-jeong will move out soon.

188
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:09,634
Seeing that her boyfriend has visited
for three days in a row,

189
00:24:11,428 --> 00:24:12,387
I can tell.

190
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,430
Yes.

191
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:14,890
Right.

192
00:24:14,973 --> 00:24:16,850
And Chang-hee also quit his job

193
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:20,020
-at the perfect time, right?
-Yes.

194
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:31,907
Seriously…

195
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:35,869
Isn't my sixth sense amazing?

196
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,334
That must have been
why I wanted to quit so badly.

197
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:47,631
But in retrospect,
I didn't want to quit that badly.

198
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:51,468
It just felt like the right time to quit.

199
00:24:54,054 --> 00:24:56,473
I guess my soul just knew.

200
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:01,686
If I weren't unemployed,

201
00:25:03,146 --> 00:25:04,773
who would take care of my dad?

202
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:12,656
After the three of us go to work,
and without Gu, he'd be all by himself.

203
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,080
The thought makes me tear up.

204
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,547
I was like this when I was younger, too.

205
00:25:29,589 --> 00:25:31,967
When I was in high school,
my homeroom teacher said

206
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,928
we'd be in trouble if anyone skipped
the after-school classes.

207
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:37,806
I had never skipped them before,

208
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:40,684
but I really wanted to
go home that day for some reason.

209
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,896
It wasn't like I had anything to do
at home. I just wanted to go home.

210
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,273
So I did.

211
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,483
My grandma was alone at home.

212
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:51,570
When I said, "I'm home,"

213
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,281
her eyes were open,
but she wouldn't answer me.

214
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:56,533
Something felt off.

215
00:25:57,534 --> 00:26:00,871
I felt like I had to
hold her hand so I did.

216
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,747
But soon,

217
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,792
I got the chills,

218
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,254
and thought, "She must be gone."

219
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,134
I suddenly got scared,
so I pulled my hand away.

220
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:16,803
Then I thought, "This isn't right."

221
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:20,515
So I held her hand tight again.

222
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,602
About five minutes later,

223
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:25,645
my dad came back.

224
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:27,898
"Where did you go, leaving Grandma alone?"

225
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:32,319
It was the first time in my life
telling Dad off like that.

226
00:26:33,403 --> 00:26:36,823
He couldn't say a thing
and just listened to me.

227
00:26:38,408 --> 00:26:39,868
And it kind of felt

228
00:26:40,827 --> 00:26:41,953
cathartic.

229
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:48,084
If I hadn't skipped school that day,

230
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:50,962
my grandma would've passed away all alone.

231
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,884
Just like this, my soul knows
and my body just follows.

232
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:11,691
I never thought…

233
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:18,114
I would be waiting
for Gi-jeong to come home.

234
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,955
After spending the whole day
with my dad alone,

235
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,416
when Gi-jeong and Mi-jeong come home…

236
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,212
it feels

237
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,090
less lonely.

238
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,651
When you feel lonely,

239
00:27:54,734 --> 00:28:00,156
I hope you remember that Oh Du-hwan
is also feeling lonely somewhere.

240
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,868
And this song is for us.

241
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:09,916
<i>I didn't say</i>

242
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:15,380
<i>Or do anything</i>

243
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:22,304
<i>Just your name alone
Makes my heart ache</i>

244
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:29,144
<i>Why didn't I know
That you'd be leaving so far away</i>

245
00:28:29,227 --> 00:28:34,900
<i>My love
I guess this is our goodbye</i>

246
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:42,949
<i>The times I've sulked at you
Without good reason</i>

247
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:50,040
<i>And the times I've been
Too harsh and negligent</i>

248
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:56,755
<i>I never got to tell you
How sorry I am</i>

249
00:28:56,838 --> 00:29:03,094
<i>My love
I guess this is our goodbye</i>

250
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:11,186
<i>No matter how many times I tell myself</i>

251
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:16,441
<i>That it'd be okay
And that you'd understand</i>

252
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:25,408
<i>The memories that I cannot forget</i>

253
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:31,706
-<i>Come a step too late as regret</i>
-It's cold. Let's go.

254
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:38,672
<i>If only for a day
I could see you again</i>

255
00:29:39,756 --> 00:29:45,595
<i>I would cry for hours on end
In your presence</i>

256
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:52,686
<i>Even the wind sounds
So quiet in the sky today</i>

257
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:59,484
<i>My love
I guess this is our goodbye</i>

258
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,406
It still bothers me
that Mr. Gu didn't come.

259
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:08,201
Don't you have any way of contacting him?

260
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,370
They don't even know his name.

261
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:14,416
How could she not know
the name of the person she dated?

262
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,380
Good night.

263
00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:21,506
Good night.

264
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:22,590
Bye.

265
00:30:22,674 --> 00:30:23,717
Good night.

266
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:39,649
<i>No matter how many times I tell myself</i>

267
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:45,697
<i>That it'd be okay
And that you'd understand</i>

268
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,913
<i>The memories that I cannot forget</i>

269
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:59,961
<i>Come a step too late as regret</i>

270
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:07,177
<i>If I get to see you once again</i>

271
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:13,725
<i>Through all my wishing</i>

272
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:21,357
<i>-I will thank you before it's too late</i>
-Mom. It's snowing.

273
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:23,318
<i>My love</i>

274
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:26,654
<i>I guess</i>

275
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:33,161
<i>This is our goodbye</i>

276
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:35,705
LATE KWAK HYE-SUK

277
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:47,342
Hello, Joy Card Design Department.

278
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:52,972
Sure, one moment, please.

279
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:01,689
Hello, Joy Card Design Department.

280
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:05,777
Hello?

281
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:07,278
<i>Is this Yeom Mi-jeong?</i>

282
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,656
Yes, this is she.

283
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:13,368
<i>This is Choi Jun-ho's wife.</i>

284
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:24,952
It's not me.

285
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,666
He just saved her as my name.

286
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:36,172
<i>What do you mean?</i>

287
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:41,260
One moment.

288
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,860
YEOM MI-JEONG (TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE)

289
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,666
I'm saved as "Yeom Mi-jeong"
with "Temporary Employee" in brackets.

290
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,376
Hey.

291
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:15,961
What are you doing?

292
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:22,718
Would you like to see who it is?

293
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,977
Damn it.

294
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,396
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

295
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,522
LEAVE

296
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,191
Okay.

297
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,695
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHAT'S GOING ON?

298
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:45,950
"SOTP" MESSAGING ME

299
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:49,245
STOP

300
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:52,998
DELETE OUR CHAT HISTORY

301
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,375
For God's sake.

302
00:33:58,087 --> 00:34:00,172
YEOM MI-JEONG

303
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:21,193
Is he crazy?

304
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:24,196
He saved the girl he's having
an affair with as "Mi-jeong"?

305
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,533
Who on earth is the woman?

306
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:28,617
How would we know?

307
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,286
Does she even work here?

308
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,996
Of course, she does.

309
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,372
No wonder.

310
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:36,583
People kept whispering about Mi-jeong
at the funeral.

311
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:37,918
Really?

312
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:41,839
They said she was dating him
to get a permanent position.

313
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:43,716
Can't you sue him for that?

314
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:58,522
<i>Are you busy? Can I stop by?</i>

315
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:19,835
MR. GU

316
00:35:21,211 --> 00:35:22,671
SEPTEMBER 19

317
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:36,935
MR. GU

318
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:37,853
CALL

319
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:44,193
<i>The number you have called
is not in service.</i>

320
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,987
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

321
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,892
My asshole team leader is
having an affair with some employee,

322
00:36:17,518 --> 00:36:19,895
and he saved her number under my name.

323
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,188
No way.

324
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:25,025
Since everyone knows he hates me,

325
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,362
he must've thought
it'd be safe if he saved it under my name.

326
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:30,864
I knew he was having an affair.

327
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:33,158
And with whom.

328
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:35,494
Who is it?

329
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:42,459
A while back, I called the two of them
since they were late for a meeting.

330
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,755
And it was eerily identical
how both calls were so silent.

331
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:50,801
There wasn't any background noise,
as if they were in a vacuum.

332
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:53,053
For the two of them.

333
00:36:53,846 --> 00:36:55,347
They were in a motel.

334
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:57,933
It became so obvious after that.

335
00:36:59,143 --> 00:37:01,770
When I saw a shampoo in her bag,

336
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,857
I wondered why she would
carry shampoo around.

337
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,694
It was to avoid smelling the same
by using different shampoos.

338
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:16,034
When that asshole
would start ranting at me…

339
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:16,952
<i>Is it that hard?</i>

340
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:20,330
{\an8}Font combination, color coordination,
color choice, is that so hard?

341
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:22,916
{\an8}-I mean, is it hard?
-<i>She would suddenly</i>

342
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,212
{\an8}<i>align a stack of papers with a "tap"</i>

343
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,922
{\an8}<i>in an elegant motion.</i>

344
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:31,758
{\an8}-Seriously…
-<i>Then he would</i>

345
00:37:31,842 --> 00:37:34,511
{\an8}<i>stop ranting at me.</i>

346
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,598
{\an8}<i>She was signaling him to stop.</i>

347
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:41,310
{\an8}Since then, whenever he started ranting,

348
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,562
{\an8}I'd end up looking at her hands,

349
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:46,440
{\an8}<i>wondering when she'd give the signal.</i>

350
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:51,028
{\an8}<i>At first, I was grateful
for her fingertips</i>

351
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:53,447
{\an8}fluttering like a butterfly.

352
00:37:54,615 --> 00:37:55,782
{\an8}But now,

353
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,411
{\an8}when she starts putting papers together,

354
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,915
{\an8}I want to break all of her fingers.

355
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,214
{\an8}MS. YEOM, CAN WE TALK FOR A MOMENT?

356
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:12,382
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW

357
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:13,467
{\an8}WE CAN TALK OVER THE PHONE

358
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,136
{\an8}It's that bastard.

359
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,643
{\an8}Don't respond.
He must be quaking in his boots.

360
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,771
{\an8}Just ignore it. Don't even read them.

361
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:36,031
It's fine. It doesn't take that long
if I take the subway, anyway.

362
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,991
I have to drive you home today.

363
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,202
Besides, my sister
made some dishes for you.

364
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,079
I'll be there in 30 minutes,

365
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:43,789
<i>so wait at my sister's place.</i>

366
00:38:44,915 --> 00:38:45,749
All right.

367
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,085
Thank you.

368
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:58,554
Hello.

369
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,599
-You're here.
-Hi.

370
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:07,437
Hi. Long time no see.

371
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:14,069
Wait here. The ribs are upstairs.

372
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,738
-Have a seat.
-You didn't have to make ribs.

373
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,740
Tae-hun even paid me to make them for you.

374
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,918
Want some cold beer?

375
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:31,420
I'll get it myself.

376
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,588
Sure.

377
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,154
I've been a bit busy these days.

378
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,114
You heard, right?

379
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,499
It's been a while since I drank beer.

380
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,131
I know

381
00:40:17,466 --> 00:40:19,676
that it gets harder if I drink.

382
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,640
I know if I drink just a little like this,

383
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,808
it'll be harder on my way home.

384
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,354
I live quite far away, you see.

385
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:33,815
I know very well it'll be hard.

386
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:41,531
But I don't want to be strong.

387
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:46,536
I just want to be knocked out.

388
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:57,714
I get like this sometimes.

389
00:40:58,507 --> 00:40:59,383
But…

390
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:02,678
I always feel okay again the next day.

391
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,396
Do grown-ups

392
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:14,439
get sad, too?

393
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:20,946
When their moms are gone.

394
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:43,719
Can't I be your mom?

395
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:48,390
I want to.

396
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:01,111
Can't I be your mom?

397
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:04,573
If you don't like it,
just give me the axe, all right?

398
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,047
Let's get married.

399
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,392
Let's get married.

400
00:42:38,106 --> 00:42:39,357
Okay, let's.

401
00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:27,322
Bye.

402
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,199
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

403
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:30,283
-I'm off.
-All right.

404
00:43:30,367 --> 00:43:32,118
CHOI JUN-HO
DESIGN TEAM 3

405
00:43:49,219 --> 00:43:50,136
Yeom Mi-jeong.

406
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,600
Just think of it as bad luck.

407
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:57,102
There's no misunderstanding.

408
00:43:57,185 --> 00:43:59,646
Who on earth would think
you two are having an affair?

409
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:04,317
Do you know who it is?

410
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:06,194
The woman he's having an affair with.

411
00:44:10,198 --> 00:44:11,116
Yes.

412
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:14,035
Who is it?

413
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,662
You can't do this to me.

414
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:02,792
I took care of you,
and this is how you repay me?

415
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:22,604
Still…

416
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:26,274
you shouldn't have
done that at the funeral.

417
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:30,070
Giggling and playing footsie
under the table!

418
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:33,239
That's not right.

419
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:50,617
I don't want

420
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:53,745
to have friends anymore.

421
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,498
I don't need them.

422
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:26,820
<i>Why does it feel like that's you?</i>

423
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:31,449
<i>Something that feels so out of place</i>

424
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,079
<i>and is screaming, "I'm here."</i>

425
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:58,768
Yeom Mi-jeong.

426
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:42,520
<i>On Mr. Choi's desktop screen,</i>

427
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:45,732
I saw messages
from someone set as my name.

428
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:50,236
The messages were obviously romantic.

429
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,572
I've never done
anything like that with Mr. Choi.

430
00:47:52,655 --> 00:47:55,617
Then why would
Mr. Choi's wife have called me?

431
00:47:56,367 --> 00:47:58,953
My wife says she's never called
the company.

432
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,582
She says she never called here
looking for Yeom Mi-jeong.

433
00:48:02,665 --> 00:48:05,293
How would I know who did what?

434
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:11,507
It's too bad this kind of incident
occurred before your review

435
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:12,967
for a permanent position.

436
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:15,386
On top of that, the assault.

437
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,932
We can't let you guys work
in the same department.

438
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:51,965
Hello.

439
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:53,132
Hey.

440
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:57,220
I still can't believe it.

441
00:48:58,054 --> 00:49:02,183
She came by here that very day.
How could she pass away just like that?

442
00:49:03,184 --> 00:49:07,355
I saw Mi-jeong crying her eyes out
saying she'd lost her dog.

443
00:49:07,438 --> 00:49:09,148
So I asked if she'd found it,

444
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:12,652
but she said she didn't have a dog,
so I asked, "Well, was it a goat then?"

445
00:49:12,735 --> 00:49:14,487
That's what we talked about.

446
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:17,240
But that very day…

447
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,202
When was that?

448
00:49:21,285 --> 00:49:23,955
That day, the day she passed.

449
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:25,331
No, I mean, Mi-jeong…

450
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:31,170
What about your dad?
Is he holding up alright?

451
00:49:32,672 --> 00:49:33,506
Yes.

452
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:36,676
You take good care of him.

453
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:38,761
I will.

454
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:40,304
Goodbye.

455
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:53,192
<i>How are Gi-jeong and Mi-jeong doing?</i>

456
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:56,738
<i>Gi-jeong cries every day,</i>

457
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:59,032
<i>and Mi-jeong's just the same, I guess.</i>

458
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,284
<i>Mi-jeong is someone</i>

459
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:05,955
<i>who can't cry
unless she plucks up the courage.</i>

460
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,431
-Thank you, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

461
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:26,059
Sure. Don't forget to send me photos
to let me know you're home later.

462
00:50:26,142 --> 00:50:26,976
-Okay!
-Okay!

463
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,352
All right, off you go.

464
00:50:28,436 --> 00:50:29,729
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

465
00:50:30,688 --> 00:50:33,816
Hey. You're back early.
Did you take the afternoon off?

466
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,526
Yes.

467
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:36,861
Out of the way!

468
00:50:57,173 --> 00:51:00,760
SANPO SINKS

469
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,527
Where's Dad?

470
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,945
In the field.

471
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:23,342
Hey, what is this?

472
00:52:25,386 --> 00:52:26,387
What do you mean?

473
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,389
Why did you take out a loan?

474
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:34,228
HANJO EMERGENCY FUND EASY LOAN
LOAN AMOUNT 2,000,000 WON

475
00:52:37,773 --> 00:52:40,026
I beat someone up a bit.
It's for the settlement.

476
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:47,825
Who?

477
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:50,286
Just some crazy bitch.

478
00:52:53,497 --> 00:52:56,918
But why did you need to get a loan?
You don't have two million won?

479
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:02,381
Show me your bankbook.

480
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:06,969
-Show me your bankbook now!
-Are you my mom?

481
00:53:16,812 --> 00:53:18,689
You lent money to Chan-hyeok, didn't you?

482
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,990
You stupid brat!

483
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,909
Why the hell did you hit her?

484
00:53:29,992 --> 00:53:32,245
Yeom Je-ho was ripped off
by his little sister.

485
00:53:32,328 --> 00:53:35,373
But what kind of idiot
lends money to her boyfriend?

486
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:40,044
What's that bastard's number?

487
00:53:41,379 --> 00:53:43,547
Give me that bastard's number!

488
00:53:44,298 --> 00:53:46,342
Are you not going to tell me? Damn it.

489
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:49,220
He's not in Korea.

490
00:53:57,979 --> 00:53:59,438
Why didn't you tell us?

491
00:53:59,522 --> 00:54:02,149
Do you have no family? No mom, no dad?

492
00:54:02,733 --> 00:54:04,277
I wouldn't have either.

493
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,862
She saw how I was treated after
my trouble with money.

494
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:08,114
Of course, she wouldn't.

495
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:10,866
I wouldn't, either.
I'd rather starve to death.

496
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,869
I'd rather be in jail
before letting any of you know.

497
00:54:14,495 --> 00:54:16,747
When did we ever rely on our family?

498
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:55,578
Gosh, thank you!

499
00:55:23,481 --> 00:55:24,315
<i>Gu…</i>

500
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:26,400
<i>Where are you now?</i>

501
00:55:27,818 --> 00:55:29,111
<i>How are you doing?</i>

502
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:34,784
<i>Gu…</i>

503
00:55:38,996 --> 00:55:40,581
<i>My mom died.</i>

504
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:56,555
Why are you ignoring me
after proposing to me?

505
00:55:57,139 --> 00:55:59,183
You're not even answering my calls.

506
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:00,518
I've been busy.

507
00:56:08,192 --> 00:56:09,151
<i>Hey.</i>

508
00:56:10,903 --> 00:56:12,405
<i>I'm not dead yet.</i>

509
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:17,368
I knew it, you two.

510
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,247
Don't worry about it.
Hyeon-a won't say yes, anyway.

511
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:22,832
What if she does?

512
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,043
He says you won't say yes.

513
00:56:27,002 --> 00:56:28,170
I will.

514
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:32,007
She said yes.

515
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:34,009
I need to make dinner.

516
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:36,721
Did you see the link I sent?

517
00:56:38,013 --> 00:56:39,306
The columbarium.

518
00:56:40,766 --> 00:56:42,852
<i>I did some research,</i>

519
00:56:43,978 --> 00:56:46,897
and that's the best place. And it's clean.

520
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:50,192
Let's put your mom's urn there.

521
00:56:50,776 --> 00:56:52,445
<i>I want mine to be there, too.</i>

522
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:56,240
I want to go wherever you put your mom.

523
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:58,325
You should stay with your mom.

524
00:56:59,034 --> 00:57:01,287
My mom is going to live very long.

525
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,873
And I'm not expecting any visitors.

526
00:57:06,542 --> 00:57:10,755
You'll come see me
if I'm placed next to your mom.

527
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:16,135
I'll reserve spots
for you and Hyeon-a, too.

528
00:57:16,218 --> 00:57:19,096
So you're going to take us with you?

529
00:57:19,847 --> 00:57:21,974
No, you guys take your time.

530
00:57:23,392 --> 00:57:26,353
Let's stay together, even when we're dead.

531
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:28,355
So that we won't be bored.

532
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:35,112
What about Mi-jeong?

533
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:37,031
What about her?

534
00:57:37,823 --> 00:57:40,159
Is she doing all right?

535
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:44,538
You should ask her yourself.
Aren't you closer to her than me?

536
00:57:51,796 --> 00:57:52,880
Chang-hee.

537
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:55,508
<i>I…</i>

538
00:57:58,552 --> 00:58:00,596
need people who are happy.

539
00:58:04,683 --> 00:58:05,935
<i>So, Chang-hee…</i>

540
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:10,731
you have to be happy.

541
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,155
I carry on thanks to you.

542
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:55,484
Dad.

543
00:58:57,319 --> 00:58:58,445
Don't worry.

544
00:58:58,529 --> 00:58:59,655
We'll…

545
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:01,949
be even happier.

546
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:08,956
But…

547
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,418
for a family of four to be happy…

548
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:16,005
we need a car.

549
00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:39,153
I think it's my first time
coming to the beach with Dad.

550
00:59:39,236 --> 00:59:41,947
It's the first time we've come
to the beach as a family.

551
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:43,866
When it was just you and me,

552
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:46,243
I have memories of going places
with Mom and Dad.

553
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:48,954
But nothing after Mi-jeong was born.

554
00:59:50,706 --> 00:59:55,377
It's because it was hard for all five
of us to go around on buses and trains.

555
00:59:56,253 --> 00:59:58,547
That's not the reason.

556
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:02,676
It's because Auntie got into trouble then.
And ever since then, nothing.

557
01:00:04,136 --> 01:00:07,306
The villain of our family is Auntie.

558
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,185
That sounds scary.
I'm going to be an aunt one day.

559
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:16,565
Hey, it's not possible for us
to become an aunt who robs her family.

560
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:18,442
Dad loved her, you know?

561
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:21,153
That's why he cared for her
and sold off his own land.

562
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:23,822
But this asshole doesn't love us
that much.

563
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:25,324
You have no idea.

564
01:00:25,908 --> 01:00:28,035
I would give you everything
if I had anything.

565
01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:29,453
I just can't because I don't.

566
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:33,082
Hey. Once we get married,
let's not bother each other over money.

567
01:00:33,165 --> 01:00:35,334
Yes. Let's not ever do that.

568
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:36,961
Never mind.

569
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,796
Bother me.

570
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,341
On second thought,
I think I'd give you money, too.

571
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,927
But you need to know this.

572
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:47,471
We can do that because we love each other.

573
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:50,015
But do you think our children
will love us that much?

574
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:52,267
I don't think so, you know?
That's the problem.

575
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:57,231
Dad loved Aunt, but we didn't.
That's the problem.

576
01:00:57,314 --> 01:01:01,694
That's why they say you can get away
with anything if you have love.

577
01:01:33,392 --> 01:01:34,810
You still have

578
01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:38,188
the three of us by your side, Dad.

579
01:01:42,735 --> 01:01:43,902
Dad…

580
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:48,449
I love you.

581
01:02:31,366 --> 01:02:35,412
I thought I was taking
care of them all this time.

582
01:02:37,122 --> 01:02:39,625
I only realized after she passed away…

583
01:02:41,502 --> 01:02:44,129
that Hye-suk and the kids

584
01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:47,800
were the ones taking care of me.

585
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:09,947
YEOM MI-JEONG

586
01:03:20,874 --> 01:03:21,959
You're…

587
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:24,753
doing well, right?

588
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:29,675
Yes, sir.

589
01:03:53,198 --> 01:03:55,701
YEOM MI-JEONG

590
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:22,853
I'm not sad at all.

591
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:29,026
But why do I keep tearing up?

592
01:05:39,513 --> 01:05:40,347
<i>Hello?</i>

593
01:05:44,768 --> 01:05:45,769
<i>Hello?</i>

594
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,646
It's been a while.

595
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:52,067
It's Gu.

596
01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,573
<i>It has been a while.</i>

597
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:02,119
How have you been?

598
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:06,415
Have you managed to liberate yourself?

599
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,126
<i>Of course not.</i>

600
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:16,717
Have you met someone who worships you?

601
01:06:19,803 --> 01:06:20,846
<i>Of course not.</i>

602
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:25,809
Let's meet up.

603
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:29,146
<i>I can't.</i>

604
01:06:30,939 --> 01:06:31,815
Why?

605
01:06:36,028 --> 01:06:37,279
<i>I've gained weight.</i>

606
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:39,448
<i>I need to lose some weight.</i>

607
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:45,370
Lose some weight in an hour and meet me.

608
01:07:51,144 --> 01:07:52,771
You haven't gained much.

609
01:08:05,826 --> 01:08:06,660
What?

610
01:08:10,163 --> 01:08:12,541
You've grown your hair.

611
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,589
Aren't I handsome?

612
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:26,054
And you've cut your hair.

613
01:08:27,097 --> 01:08:28,306
Yes, a little.

614
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:32,727
You changed your number.

615
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,105
That was a bold move.

616
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,613
I was so angry waiting for you to call.

617
01:08:45,824 --> 01:08:48,118
It's not like you don't know where I live.

618
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,620
I thought you'd be able to
if you really wanted to.

619
01:08:52,873 --> 01:08:55,459
You never called my previous number.

620
01:08:56,668 --> 01:08:57,544
Did you?

621
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:05,385
I missed you. So much.

622
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:10,891
It sounds real now that I've said it.

623
01:09:12,976 --> 01:09:14,936
It feels like I really missed you so much.

624
01:09:20,775 --> 01:09:24,196
I wanted to squeeze you
and swallow you down in one mouthful.

625
01:09:30,243 --> 01:09:32,037
Aren't I good at worshiping now?

626
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,633
What is your name?

627
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:49,054
It's Gu Ja-gyeong.

628

MY LIBERATION NOTES

630
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,507
Why didn't you call me sooner?

631
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:31,513
<i>He'd never let me hit rock bottom.</i>

632
01:10:31,596 --> 01:10:33,139
Do you want a part-time job?

633
01:10:33,807 --> 01:10:35,892
<i>We agreed to get married
when she turns 20.</i>

634
01:10:35,976 --> 01:10:40,188
But when she's 20, I'll be 50. Damn it.

635
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:42,524
<i>Didn't you say
it was over between you two?</i>

636
01:10:42,607 --> 01:10:44,776
I've always known
what kind of a person you are.

637
01:10:44,859 --> 01:10:46,069
<i>I'll be here for you.</i>

638
01:10:47,362 --> 01:10:49,155
<i>-What?
-You son of a bitch!</i>

639
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:50,657
<i>When I met you again,</i>

640
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,950
