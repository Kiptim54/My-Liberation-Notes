I got it.

7
00:01:15,768 --> 00:01:18,250
Put this over there. Right there.

8
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:20,441
This is the top.

9
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,592
-That's the top, okay?
-Okay.

10
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:41,533
Gosh.

11
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:14,948
Thanks for this.

12
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,594
You're welcome.
Get washed up and come have lunch.

15
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:51,382
Yeom Mi-jeong doesn't live here.

16
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,325
You're at the right place.

17
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,882
What? But this one
is addressed to her house.

18
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,901
-Should I leave this here too?
-That goes over there.

NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY

22
00:03:41,256 --> 00:03:44,275
It's never been this hot.
What's happening to this planet?

23
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,579
I can't wait for winter to come.

24
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:57,881
When it does,
you're going to wish it was summer again.

25
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:04,456
Let's remember how we're feeling right now
and use it when it gets cold.

26
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:07,888
We'll save it for winter.

27
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,231
You can just use your memories
from last winter right now then.

28
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,919
Didn't you save anything to remember?

Your letter's here.

31
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:17,530
I'll pick it up later.

32
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:25,015
I'm home.

33
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,399
What did Mr. Gu say to you?

34
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,072
It's not like him to say something first.

35
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:35,437
What did he say?

36
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,772
He has some of our plates to return.
I said I'd pick them up later.

37
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,031
I tell him to bring them over,
but he always forgets.

38
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:48,878
The table is set. Eat before you wash up.

39
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,227
I'll be heading out then.

40
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,957
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay, see you.

41
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,848
You know, my neighborhood really is great.

42
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,330
It's close to work
and it's a nice place to live.

43
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,439
I can show you around when you're free.

44
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,176
Yes, sure.

45
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,905
Just pick whatever day works for you.

46
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:14,683
I can always make time.

47
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:16,958
All right, see you.

48
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,405
Okay, see you tomorrow.

49
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:19,398
 Bye.

50
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,839
Tell him to eat something
if he's going to be drinking like that.

51
00:06:57,775 --> 00:06:59,429
I'm home.

52
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:02,324
Hey, you did a good job today.

53
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:04,144
Did you eat?

54
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,945
I left work when it was bright outside,
but it's already night.

55
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,178
My evening is gone.

56
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,528
Come and eat.

57
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,464
You'll feel better if you eat this.

58
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,573
I already finished three bowls.

OUTSTANDING BALANCE
15,484,000 WON

63
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,521
I'll leave this here for now.

64
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,187
I can't keep it at my house.

65
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,051
Someone might see it.

66
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,518
The bank

67
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:15,694
refused have it sent anywhere
other than my registered address,

68
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:18,052
so I changed my address to here.

69
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:21,030
I'm sorry. I didn't have time to ask you.

70
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,483
Why does he want me to move
to his neighborhood? He has a girlfriend.

71
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,501
Because it's a nice place to live.
He's not into you.

72
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:06,065
But he shouldn't say that
to another woman.

73
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,919
Can't people with girlfriends tell others
how nice their neighborhood is?

74
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:13,799
That's not all he said.
He says I should move there.

75
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,776
Do you ask just anyone
to move to your neighborhood?

76
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,799
You fell for him already, didn't you?

77
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,415
It's because he told me
to move to his neighborhood.

78
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:34,311
I had no interest in him at all
before that.

79
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,348
Jerks who lead girls on for fun like him,

80
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,285
should all go extinct.
They should be straightforward like me.

81
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:45,476
If I don't like them,
I kick them to the curb--

82
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,620
Kick them to the curb?
What is this, a taekwondo match?

83
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:50,852
Look what you've done.

84
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:53,872
What?

85
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,278
Don't play dumb.

86
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:01,770
Thank you for dinner.

87
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:03,466
Sure, good night.

88
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,022
<i>That's right. Seeing how…</i>

89
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,992
<i>-Yes. That was great.
-And with that he…</i>

90
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:36,592
<i>If a payment is over five days late,
my credit card will get suspended.</i>

91
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:39,280
<i>So I made this month's payment.</i>

92
00:11:39,941 --> 00:11:41,058
<i>Call me.</i>

93
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:39,227
I checked my lunch mates for today,

94
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,502
and Min Ho-sik is there.

95
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,439
MS. KIM JI-HUI WILL BE SEATED AT TABLE 16

96
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,713
MIN HO-SHIK, MARKETING, ASSISTANT MANAGER

97
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:05,488
-Iced? Iced Americano?
-Yes.

98
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,068
I like iced Americanos too.

99
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,441
I don't think
the tables are randomly picked.

100
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:45,272
We're all people
who didn't sign up for any clubs.

101
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,144
I'm a member of a club though.

102
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:53,915
-You are?
-Yes.

103
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,468
Haven't you joined any?

104
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,957
No.

105
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,232
You two don't either?

106
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,909
No.

107
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:23,070
Why not?

108
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,218
I live too far away.

109
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:32,624
I see.

110
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:35,146
Where?

111
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:38,619
Sanpo.

112
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:42,300
It's near Suwon.

113
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,161
I see.

114
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,274
What about you, sir?

115
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,418
Who would want me in their club?

116
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,711
Two iced Americanos and a hot one, please.

117
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:12,944
What do you want, Ms. Bang?

118
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:14,723
IA, please.

119
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,423
And one IA, please.

120
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,526
They're now making lunch
uncomfortable too.

121
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,752
Do I have to know everyone here?

122
00:16:14,564 --> 00:16:17,128
Why do I need to know
people in other departments?

123
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,609
It's hard enough with those in mine.

124
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,688
It's as if everyone here used to be
popular kids at school.

125
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,493
I'll never join any club.

126
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:39,004
-Bye.
-Bye.

127
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:50,915
My sister…

128
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:55,216
wanted me to tell you
that she was sorry about the other day.

129
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,510
Was she your sister?

130
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:02,908
Yes.

131
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:06,919
I see.

132
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,104
You don't look alike.

133
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:23,792
Thanks.

134
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,018
YSTAT RESEARCH

135
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,785
Isn't it Ms. Lee's turn
to do the emergency research?

136
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,582
I'll tell you later.

137
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,974
All right, let's head inside.

138
00:17:55,057 --> 00:17:56,049
Hello, Ms. Yeom.

139
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,707
Yesterday, a well-known politician said

140
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,775
35-year-olds should no longer
be considered young

141
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,215
and that youth ends at the age of 29.

142
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:10,979
Some people consider his remarks
to be more anachronistic than others do.

143
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,535
I, for one, believe I'm still young

144
00:18:14,618 --> 00:18:16,975
so I think it's absolutely preposterous.

145
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,780
I was just joking. Now.

146
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:25,246
We're all here today to figure out

147
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:28,471
at what age the general public
considers youth to be over.

148
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,367
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

149
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,386
I will relay a few things to keep in mind.

150
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,867
-Hello? I'm calling from Ystat…
-Hello? We are a research company…

151
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,769
…will not be used to make a profit,

152
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,085
and under Article 33
of the Statistics Act,

153
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,153
your information
will be kept confidential.

154
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:46,254
We'd appreciate it
if you could spare a moment of your time.

155
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:50,059
Park Jin-u broke up with Ms. Lee.

156
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,447
Well, she's not the first woman
he's dated at work.

157
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,845
Did she think they'd last longer?

158
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:03,913
Anyway, it's good.

159
00:19:03,996 --> 00:19:07,180
Now that he's dated every woman here,
there isn't anyone left for him to date.

160
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,503
He'll be quiet for a while.

161
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:15,906
What age range
would you consider to be youth?

162
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:22,316
Rumor has it that he and a new girl
in the management are a thing.

163
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,113
Unbelievable.

164
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,391
Ms. Yeom, agent 37 keeps
on asking leading questions.

165
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,501
I think we should scrap all of their data.

166
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,782
Okay, I'll check.

167
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:38,734
Okay.

168
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,373
You didn't hear anything, okay?

169
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,371
Where's Hyeon-a?

170
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:11,983
She's coming with Mi-jeong.

171
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:21,785
It's been a long time
since you came out to Seoul, right?

172
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,390
You should've worn gold chains too.

173
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:27,864
Du-hwan.

174
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:29,766
Oh Du-hwan.

175
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,613
Don't ever meet
any girls during the summer.

176
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,349
You seriously smell.

177
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,616
Make sure you only see them in winter.

178
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,008
How could you be so cruel?

179
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,778
He lives alone.
He wouldn't know unless someone tells him.

180
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,677
Yes. Have a drink.

181
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,406
Toss that shirt out. I'm serious.

182
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:58,426
Once it starts to stink,
it'll never go away. Throw it away.

183
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,072
If I see it again, I'll burn it. I swear.

184
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:05,745
You've kept that for years
because it's designer.

185
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,689
No one would consider this designer.

186
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,479
<i>A politician's comment
regarding the age of young people</i>

187
00:21:13,561 --> 00:21:15,050
<i>has sparked controversy.</i>

188
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,069
<i>Currently, each local government
defines it differently.</i>

189
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,881
<i>In Seoul, it is considered that
youth ends at the age of 29,</i>

190
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:22,825
<i>but in Jeolla-do, it's 39,</i>

191
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,216
<i>and in Bonghwa-gun,
North Gyeongsang-do, it's 49.</i>

192
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,814
<i>We asked the citizens of Seoul what
they considered to be the appropriate age</i>

193
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,461
<i>at which a person should
no longer be classified as youth.</i>

194
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,528
<i>And 56 percent of the respondents</i>

195
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:36,803
<i>answered that youth should be
between the ages of 19 to 29.</i>

196
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:41,062
-<i>If youth is defined to be…</i>
-I just don't get it.

197
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:47,059
Is he addicted
to dating people at work or what?

198
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:49,127
Can't he find a girl anywhere else?

199
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:52,063
I guess Park Jin-u
has found himself a new girl.

200
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:57,398
I feel like I know him now
because you talk so much about him.

201
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,217
It's not just him.

202
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,285
It's the girls that I have
a harder time understanding.

203
00:22:01,368 --> 00:22:03,601
They all know who he's been with.

204
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:05,793
He's already dated
a bunch of girls at work.

205
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,447
Why do they still go out with him?

206
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,872
Why do they want to belittle themselves
by becoming another one of his girls?

207
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,195
I really don't get it.

208
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:15,718
You don't have to get it.

209
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,538
It's you that I don't get.

210
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:22,541
{\an8}They're fine with having a casual fling.
How is it any of your business?

211
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,354
{\an8}And how is that belittling?

212
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:28,083
{\an8}Then have the girls I've dated
belittled themselves too?

213
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,516
{\an8}From my point of view,
they're like one of the girls I've dated.

214
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,632
{\an8}I mean,

215
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:35,817
{\an8}does everyone need to be like you
and only ever love one person,

216
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,580
{\an8}or pretend they're the only person
they've ever been with?

217
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,102
{\an8}They live in a different world from yours.

218
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:44,212
{\an8}So just leave them to enjoy themselves.

219
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:46,817
{\an8}They're all happy and having a blast.

220
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,512
{\an8}They don't care what others think.

221
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:50,953
{\an8}You can bad-mouth them,
but they just don't care.

222
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,942
{\an8}Why hasn't he ever asked me out?

223
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:12,251
{\an8}You've got to be kidding me.

224
00:23:13,078 --> 00:23:15,600
{\an8}He dates everyone, so why did he skip me?

225
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,694
{\an8}I'm sure Jin-u has his own taste in women.

226
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,382
{\an8}I'm at least in the top ten at work.

227
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,104
{\an8}Out of how many women? Are there like 20?

228
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:28,627
{\an8}He's even dated
someone way less attractive than I am.

229
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,488
{\an8}So why won't he date me?

230
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:31,812
{\an8}See?

231
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:35,327
{\an8}When I hit her with the facts,
she just ignores me and keeps going.

232
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,022
{\an8}You should've become a politician.

233
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:41,365
{\an8}Some of them may be prettier than me,
but none of them are as charming as me.

234
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,868
It's true. I think I'm pretty awesome.

235
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:57,865
I'm a woman who has a lot of charm.

236
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:05,350
Hey, drink up. Let's just drink.

237
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:08,411
Why aren't the girls here yet?

238
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:12,711
You know, I…

239
00:24:15,151 --> 00:24:18,542
I'm embarrassed
that you're my older sister.

240
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:26,566
I feel you, Gi-jeong.
I can see why you're offended.

241
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:27,641
Yes.

242
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:34,423
This may not be the right time to ask,

243
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,212
but that girl in your office with
"nasty, nasty, nasty" all over her face,

244
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:45,796
Park Jin-u's dated her too, right?

245
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,172
I knew it.

246
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,033
It's just as expected.

247
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,969
I bet she has a beautiful face.

248
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:56,879
Right?

249
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,774
I am 100 percent sure she's pretty.

250
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:02,958
And I think she's not just pretty

251
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,018
but also pretty charming.

252
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,594
Hey.

253
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:15,323
I'm in front of the statue in the square.

254
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,225
Where are you?

255
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:21,403
Over here!

256
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,937
You got off late today.

257
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:29,425
So we could go together.

258
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:30,666
Let's go.

259
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,320
Hold on.

260
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:36,869
That jerk…

261
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,350
Who is it?

262
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,569
Nobody. Let's go. Who's there?

263
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:50,847
-Hey, they're here.
-Right.

264
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,998
-Hey!
-Hey, guys.

265
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:54,238
Hey.

266
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,272
You're so late.

267
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,389
What took you so long?

268
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,423
Sorry.

269
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,656
Someone here has been a serious buzzkill.

270
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,724
-Why?
-You should've come sooner.

271
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:05,569
<i>-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you</i>

272
00:26:05,653 --> 00:26:09,499
<i>Happy birthday dear Hyeon-a
Happy birthday to you</i>

273
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:15,247
Cheers.

274
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,405
Bottoms up.

275
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:22,526
Here, try some of this.

276
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:24,303
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

277
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,500
What do you mean there are no guys?

278
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,650
There's a bunch right here.

279
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:37,372
It's because you look for
someone who's worth 80 points.

280
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:40,722
And even if you do find him,
you grill him about the 20 points he lacks

281
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:43,864
while you look for someone better.
That's what you do.

282
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:45,685
Love is not for everyone.

283
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,131
Don't kid yourself.

284
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:53,170
I mean, I go out with guys who are
worth 20 points because I like them.

285
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,858
What's wrong with 20 points?
That's 20 points above zero.

286
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,166
If I get lucky and meet someone
who's worth 30 points, I'm just grateful.

287
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,986
And if it's 40points,
then I've hit the jackpot.

288
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:06,692
I mean, I'd understand
if you're worth 80 points yourself.

289
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:09,835
Do you want me to be honest
and tell you how many points you're worth?

290
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,944
Should I be brutally frank?

291
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:12,979
Hey.

292
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,031
I'm just saying,
you could use a little self-awareness.

293
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:19,926
Everyone else knows you except for you.

294
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,550
Besides, you're not going to do it anyway.

295
00:27:25,634 --> 00:27:27,329
You're not going to love just anyone.

296
00:27:30,638 --> 00:27:32,540
That's enough. Why are you being so mean?

297
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:37,254
And why are you guys
letting Gi-jeong do this to herself?

298
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:40,397
Mi-jeong. Why did you let it come to this?

299
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,920
You're at fault too.
Knock some sense into her.

300
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:43,871
Hey.

301
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,683
Why are you so upset anyway?

302
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:50,199
We all waited for you
to celebrate your birthday.

303
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:52,763
They came all the way here from Sanpo.

304
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:56,443
Do you want to stop seeing
your hometown friends?

305
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,849
Were we too dense to notice?

306
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:01,819
It's not that.

307
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:02,812
Then what?

308
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:05,748
It's her birthday.
Cut her some slack, okay?

309
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,684
Hyeon-a can do
whatever she wants to do today.

310
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,379
Be as crabby as you want!

311
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,286
I'm going to break up with my boyfriend.

312
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:25,846
Why?

313
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,140
Forget it. I'm not even interested.

314
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:32,670
It's not the first time.

315
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,509
He says he's going to buy a bed…

316
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,607
when we've been together
for over two years.

317
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,258
I mean, you know beds aren't cheap.

318
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,434
I'm supposed to buy one when we
get married, so why would he buy it?

319
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,032
It didn't occur to him
because he's not planning to marry me.

320
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:06,871
Maybe he's just rich.

321
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,070
Yes.

322
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,713
That jerk has no money.

323
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:21,345
And it's not even a double, it's a single.
An 800,000-won single bed.

324
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:25,026
That's crazy, isn't it?
He wants to be single forever, right?

325
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:33,462
-And he's 43 years old.
-Right.

326
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:43,636
You want to get married?

327
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:46,572
Of course.

328
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:50,335
Can't I get married just because
I prefer open relationships?

329
00:29:50,418 --> 00:29:51,534
I'm open to anything.

330
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:53,933
I'm up for anything.

331
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,361
We've been together for two years.

332
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,546
But even after two years,

333
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,945
he still doesn't think I'm the one.

334
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:14,155
Just ask him
if he's going to marry you or not.

335
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,637
No, why would I do that?

336
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,355
By the way, who has he been talking
to for so long?

337
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:30,491
Is he on bad terms with his girlfriend?

338
00:30:31,814 --> 00:30:32,931
They broke up.

339
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,240
They already broke up.

340
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,141
Who is it then?

341
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,337
It must be Byeon Sang-mi then.

342
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,017
Some convenience store owner.

343
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,044
She's the type of woman

344
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,650
who calls you whenever
and yammers on for an hour

345
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,586
complaining about her husband,
her son, and so on.

346
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:01,466
You've got to be kidding me.

347
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,910
I hope somebody rescues him.

348
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,723
Hey! Why would you go in there?

349
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:33,723
Hey. What are you doing?

350
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:35,418
We're breaking up!

351
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:39,140
How could you ditch your girlfriend
to talk to another woman for an hour?

352
00:31:39,223 --> 00:31:40,960
Just go out with her instead then!

353
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:09,453
<i>People are</i>

354
00:32:10,156 --> 00:32:12,555
<i>so good with words.</i>

355
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,337
{\an8}<i>Once you reach a certain point,</i>

356
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,653
{\an8}<i>you start playing with your words.</i>

357
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:27,113
{\an8}<i>And once you start to enjoy drawing
attention to yourself with your words…</i>

358
00:32:28,477 --> 00:32:30,049
{\an8}<i>there's no turning back.</i>

359
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,342
{\an8}Do you think there's even a single thing

360
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:37,947
{\an8}coming out of my mouth
that's actually worthwhile?

361
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:40,139
{\an8}There isn't. Not one.

362
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,060
{\an8}So I don't

363
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:48,369
{\an8}want you to ever reach that point.

364
00:32:50,726 --> 00:32:53,124
{\an8}<i>It feels like I'm taking a detour</i>

365
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:55,523
{\an8}<i>because I'm too afraid
to walk on the right path.</i>

366
00:32:56,763 --> 00:32:58,997
{\an8}<i>But I've come so far away</i>

367
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,636
{\an8}<i>that I can't even dare to turn back.</i>

368
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:06,814
{\an8}<i>I like</i>

369
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:10,659
{\an8}<i>that you don't try to get attention
from people with your words.</i>

370
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:16,284
{\an8}<i>That's why each and every word
you utter is so special.</i>

371
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,134
<i>If I ever get to be born again,</i>

372
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,698
<i>I want to be born as you, Hyeon-a.</i>

373
00:33:52,717 --> 00:33:55,406
I was like you in my previous life

374
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,747
and decided to live recklessly
if I were born again. And that's me now.

375
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:04,338
Then I'll realize
that this isn't right either

376
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,060
and decide to have a quiet life
the next time around.

377
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:09,135
And that's you.

378
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:15,173
You and I have been switching
back and forth millions of times.

379
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:17,613
Why are you acting so naive?

380
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:43,708
<i>I want all of us to be happy.</i>

381
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,926
<i>As bright and cheery as a sunny day.</i>

382
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,739
<i>Without so much as a crease in our hearts.</i>

383
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:05,999
WE WILL BE WITH YOU 365 DAYS A YEAR

384
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:13,608
Hello.

385
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:18,777
You want to add more shelves?

386
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,060
MANAGER BYEON SANG-MI

387
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,857
God, it's cold. Aren't you cold?
I think you set the temperature too low.

388
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,619
Well, adding a shelf to everything
won't really work.

389
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:31,349
You still need
to be able to see the mirror.

390
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:33,665
So how about just doing
this one and that one?

391
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:37,180
I think about 30cm should do it.

392
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:44,707
Hey, did you really break up
because of me?

393
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,967
It was about time we did anyway.
Don't worry about it.

394
00:35:50,455 --> 00:35:52,068
What have I done?

395
00:35:55,335 --> 00:36:00,008
Why don't I call your girlfriend
and try to explain things?

396
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,144
Which works better for you,
the 25th or the 27th?

397
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:06,005
For the maintenance team to come.

398
00:36:13,656 --> 00:36:14,565
Hello?

399
00:36:16,013 --> 00:36:16,840
Yes.

400
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,156
I see.

401
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:22,051
The plastic chair was spinning around
because of the wind

402
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,400
and dinged that car all by itself.

403
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:29,908
The owner said I'd have to sell
this store if I was to pay for it.

404
00:36:29,991 --> 00:36:32,390
Jeez, what a load of crap.

405
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:34,995
He said his car was…

406
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:36,856
I've never even heard of it before.

407
00:36:38,303 --> 00:36:39,751
I thought my life was over then.

408
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:43,679
Call me when something like that happens.
Insurance covers all of that.

409
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:46,491
You looked like a god to me
at that moment.

410
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:48,808
Jeez, seriously.

411
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,743
Mr. Yeom, we have to
stick it out together until the end.

412
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:55,176
I'll replace the table with a wooden one
with benches attached.

413
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:56,458
Thank you so much.

414
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:57,906
Mr. Yeom.

415
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:00,718
You and I have to
stay partners forever, okay?

416
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,785
-Did you get the health certificate?
-Right.

417
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:06,425
I told you you need to have it
to put a coffee machine in the store.

418
00:37:07,252 --> 00:37:08,616
I just don't have the time.

419
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,436
Can you ring this up?

420
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,346
Sure.

421
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,125
Why did you come? It's raining.

422
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:26,110
Wait, hang on.

423
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,452
-Can I help you find something?
-Wet wipes.

424
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:32,355
They're over there, right there.

425
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:33,429
Okay.

426
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:37,607
We'll take this too--

427
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:44,182
That'll be 9,000 won.

428
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,235
We should hurry and get out of Seoul.

429
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,844
Have a good day.

430
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:37,613
Are you working?

431
00:38:39,473 --> 00:38:40,591
What are you doing here?

432
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,899
There are no cameras around here,
so I'm just killing time.

433
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:45,884
Did you have lunch?

434
00:38:46,504 --> 00:38:47,662
Expired food.

435
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:49,027
Aren't you sick of it?

436
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:50,681
Not yet.

437
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:54,858
I wish I could work in an office.

438
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,504
I want to sit inside a building

439
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,309
where it's quiet even if
there's a thunderstorm going on outside.

440
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,107
We've been working like this
for eight years.

441
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:09,125
If neither of us
makes team leader this time,

442
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:11,193
let's just quit.

443
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,453
We'll make it this time.

444
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:17,934
We have to.

445
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,476
-See you later.
-Bye.

446
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,912
-Isn't it great?
-How many tickets did he give you?

447
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,732
-Five.
-Five?

448
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,634
I've never won 5,000 won on the lottery.

449
00:39:35,717 --> 00:39:38,529
-This is amazing.
-Seriously. I've never--

450
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,051
I guess Mr. Park gave that to you.

451
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:43,823
Yes.

452
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,123
You're the new hire
with the management team, right?

453
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:51,473
Yes. Nice to meet you.

454
00:39:52,672 --> 00:39:56,518
He said he was gifting you excitement
when he gave it to you, right?

455
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,372
That you'd be excited on Saturday.

456
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:02,018
How did you know that?

457
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:07,270
There isn't a single girl here
who hasn't received a lottery ticket

458
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:08,676
from Mr. Park.

459
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:13,474
Why does he always give them
on Mondays and not Fridays?

460
00:40:13,557 --> 00:40:16,866
He wants you to think about him
all week whenever you look at your ticket.

461
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:19,470
It's such a cheap move, don't you think?

462
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:20,587
It costs 5,000 won.

463
00:40:23,027 --> 00:40:26,046
But it still makes you pretty excited.

464
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:29,643
On the weekend, you suddenly go,
"Right, the lottery ticket."

465
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,215
Isn't that right?

466
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:36,633
Right.

467
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,679
Apparently, he spends at least
50,000 won on lottery tickets every week.

468
00:40:43,498 --> 00:40:45,152
Isn't he a pretty good boss?

469
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,171
I like it better than coffee.

470
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:14,101
<i>Again, he's given
lottery tickets to everyone but me.</i>

471
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:20,387
He's given them to married women
and new employees.

472
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:25,266
He's given them to everyone but me.

473
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:31,842
Just ask him straight up
why he keeps on leaving you out.

474
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:47,723
I just want to get a call from anyone…

475
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,733
and talk about anything.

476
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,572
You've been talking all this time.

477
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:58,764
You talk all the time.

478
00:41:59,591 --> 00:42:01,245
You still want to talk more?

479
00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:06,787
I've never said
what I really wanted to say.

480
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:13,776
I don't want to just say things
to feel like I exist.

481
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:16,961
I want to talk to relax.

482
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:20,848
A conversation…

483
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:30,111
Words that make you feel relaxed.

484
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:36,770
I say I want to have sex,

485
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:41,195
but the truth is,
I want to talk with a man.

486
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:01,045
Yes.

487
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,489
<i>Why are you asking about Chan-hyeok?</i>

488
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,451
I want to ask him something
but I can't reach him.

489
00:43:15,478 --> 00:43:17,463
<i>He's been borrowing money here and there,</i>

490
00:43:17,545 --> 00:43:19,448
<i>so things have gotten awkward
for everyone.</i>

491
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,238
<i>I had a bad feeling when he started
to boast about starting his own business.</i>

492
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:28,463
<i>I heard he closed his business
and went to Thailand.</i>

493
00:43:29,249 --> 00:43:31,896
<i>He couldn't carry on here
because of his bad credit.</i>

494
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:35,205
<i>And who did he go to?
I bet he went to Se-yeong.</i>

495
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,761
<i>Some say Se-yeong suggested it first.</i>

496
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,814
<i>They broke up and got back together
over and over. Now it's come to this.</i>

497
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,239
<i>But why do you need to talk to him?</i>

498
00:43:49,389 --> 00:43:50,506
It's nothing.

499
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:52,367
Come on, tell me.

500
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:54,434
It's nothing.

501
00:43:55,303 --> 00:43:56,627
<i>Don't tell me</i>

502
00:43:57,454 --> 00:43:59,273
<i>you went out with him.</i>

503
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:02,912
Of course not.

504
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,916
He walked me to my house.

505
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,093
But he's… What do I do
if he's not replying anymore?

506
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:13,664
You'll find out in the end.

507
00:44:14,698 --> 00:44:15,608
I have a blind date.

508
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:18,420
He's a dermatologist.

509
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,777
-What if he keeps staring at my skin?
-No way.

510
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:23,879
It was great when we were eating.
He even took me home.

511
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,511
-But he won't return your texts?
-Correct.

512
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:31,116
Maybe he doesn't check his phone.

513
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,556
Please, in this day and age?

514
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:34,466
Hey.

515
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:36,286
Should I text him again?

516
00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:37,733
Should I text him?

517
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:40,462
Hey, isn't Mi-jeong adorable?

518
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,158
-She is.
-Yes.

519
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:44,308
She's so cute.

520
00:44:44,392 --> 00:44:45,260
She's cute.

521
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:47,493
She's very cute.

522
00:44:53,986 --> 00:44:58,163
<i>When I was in the first grade,
I once scored 20 out of 100 on a test.</i>

523
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:04,490
<i>I was told to get
my parents' signatures on the test.</i>

524
00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:06,930
<i>I couldn't bring myself to show them.</i>

525
00:45:07,012 --> 00:45:11,190
<i>And whenever I looked at my bag,
my heart felt heavier than a rock.</i>

526
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:17,889
<i>I had to get it signed
but I couldn't show them.</i>

527
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:20,163
<i>Something I had to figure out</i>

528
00:45:20,949 --> 00:45:22,521
<i>but couldn't bring myself to.</i>

529
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:28,848
<i>I wonder why
I'm reminded of that right now.</i>

530
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:51,015
<i>I don't know what I should be
more embarrassed about.</i>

531
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:55,604
<i>Is it me, the fool
who lent money to some guy?</i>

532
00:45:55,688 --> 00:45:58,996
<i>Or is it him, the guy who couldn't
pay back the money he owes to a girl?</i>

533
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:00,030
<i>Or is it</i>

534
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:03,545
<i>the fact that he ran off
to his ex-girlfriend?</i>

535
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:10,452
<i>I can't tell which of the three
is the test paper I'm trying to hide.</i>

536
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:22,031
<i>Maybe</i>…

537
00:46:23,437 --> 00:46:25,380
<i>it's just me who's worth 20 points.</i>

538
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:23,623
Oh, dear. What are we going to do
about all this blood?

539
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:26,931
Good heavens. Gosh, are you okay?

540
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:30,364
Oh, dear. This is terrible.
Absolutely terrible.

541
00:47:33,423 --> 00:47:34,830
What's taking him so long?

542
00:47:35,823 --> 00:47:39,007
-Come on, Mr. Gu. Let's get you up.
-Oh, God. Here.

543
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,819
Here we go. Put your shoes on.

544
00:47:43,722 --> 00:47:45,623
Oh, good heavens.

545
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:46,575
Be careful.

546
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,684
-Gosh.
-Oh, my God.

547
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:03,778
Oh, dear.

548
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,079
Get back inside. I'll see you later.

549
00:48:08,162 --> 00:48:09,444
Be careful.

550
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,336
SANPO SINKS

551
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,061
Oh, dear.

552
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,287
How terrible.

553
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:33,224
My goodness.

554
00:48:35,828 --> 00:48:37,442
I went to get him for dinner,

555
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:40,419
and he woke up
with a bruise and blood on his face.

556
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:43,066
I asked him what happened,
and he didn't even know.

557
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:45,506
He must have gotten drunk and tripped.

558
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,318
He was too drunk to feel anything
and just passed out.

559
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:51,461
He was drunk all winter, wasn't he?

560
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:54,562
We just barely turned him
into a decent human being,

561
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:57,458
then he does this
the very moment he gets a day off.

562
00:48:58,492 --> 00:49:01,965
It's not as though we can give him work
when there isn't any work to give.

563
00:49:02,916 --> 00:49:04,322
What did he use to do?

564
00:49:04,405 --> 00:49:05,480
How would I know?

565
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:08,292
He doesn't give me
a straight answer when I ask him.

566
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:12,098
I asked his name,
and he hesitated to tell me.

567
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,653
I asked him what I should call him,
and he just said, "My last name is Gu."

568
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,053
Maybe he's in hiding here.

569
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:28,722
Don't look after him too much.
We don't even know who he is.

570
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,320
I'm sure he's not a bad person.

571
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:45,843
He probably had
something bad happen to him.

572
00:49:45,926 --> 00:49:49,027
I doubt he'd do something bad.
He's probably the victim.

573
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:55,230
So-ra's grandma calls me all the time
to go and check on Mr. Gu.

574
00:49:55,314 --> 00:49:58,621
She's just worried that someone might die
in the house she's renting out.

575
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,938
She said he paid a year's rent upfront.

576
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,799
This town

577
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,100
isn't dramatic enough for someone
as young as him to suddenly drop dead.

578
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:09,002
In my entire life,

579
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:14,751
all I've ever seen happen here
is old people dying and floods in summer.

580
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,479
Nothing big happens around here.
Nothing at all.

581
00:50:29,928 --> 00:50:31,210
He is impossible.

582
00:50:36,048 --> 00:50:37,165
He bought alcohol again.

583
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,706
AMERICANO

584
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:07,195
Hey, are you going to Guam too?

585
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,007
Guam? What are you talking about?

586
00:52:14,473 --> 00:52:19,312
I was upset because I thought you were
also going but weren't telling me.

587
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:25,225
Su-jin, Ji-hui, and the girls
are going to Guam for vacation.

588
00:52:26,673 --> 00:52:28,576
<i>They'd stop chatting whenever I showed up.</i>

589
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,895
Why would they keep it a secret?
It's offensive.

590
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,384
As if we'd tag along.

591
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:41,520
But I thought you and Su-jin
were quite close.

592
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:47,805
I don't have money for that.

593
00:52:52,189 --> 00:52:53,926
-It's very nice.
-You have it here too.

594
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:55,043
It's so pretty.

595
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:56,325
I wish they were longer.

596
00:52:56,408 --> 00:52:58,103
Do you know a good place?

597
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:01,081
It's beautiful. I love it.

598
00:53:01,163 --> 00:53:02,114
Yours look nice too.

599
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:04,472
They look great on you.

600
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:05,878
-Thanks.
-Really?

601
00:53:07,408 --> 00:53:08,648
I messed up so many times.

602
00:53:12,618 --> 00:53:13,984
Damn it.

603
00:53:17,747 --> 00:53:19,814
Oh, for God's sake.

604
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,439
EMPHASIZE

605
00:53:41,649 --> 00:53:43,966
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

606
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:51,121
I've found the perfect club
for you, Ms. Yeom.

607
00:53:52,154 --> 00:53:53,767
A recital club.

608
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:56,373
"Recital."

609
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:58,854
It rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?

610
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,170
I like it

611
00:54:01,252 --> 00:54:03,982
when a word matches exactly how it sounds.

612
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:05,222
"Recital."

613
00:54:05,967 --> 00:54:08,448
{\an8}It somehow sounds lonely and aloof.

614
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:10,350
{\an8}It's the perfect word for it.

615
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:15,355
{\an8}This club has been formed recently

616
00:54:15,437 --> 00:54:18,538
{\an8}by three employees
from the engineering department.

617
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,226
{\an8}I thought of you immediately
as soon as I saw it.

618
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,005
{\an8}"She should join the recital club."

619
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:25,941
{\an8}"Ms. Yeom is perfect
for the recital club."

620
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:38,431
{\an8}I don't think I can do it.

621
00:54:41,822 --> 00:54:42,649
{\an8}Sorry?

622
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:46,081
{\an8}It's exhausting.

623
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:54,063
{\an8}Okay.

624
00:54:57,371 --> 00:54:59,232
{\an8}Right, sure.

625
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,672
{\an8}You live far away and all.

626
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:16,767
{\an8}<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

627
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:22,225
{\an8}<i>I don't know
when it all started to go wrong,</i>

{\an8}<i>but I'm exhausted.</i>

629
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,869
<i>Every relationship</i>

630
00:55:32,151 --> 00:55:33,474
<i>feels like work.</i>

631
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:38,354
<i>Every moment that I'm awake…</i>

632
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:41,125
<i>feels like work.</i>

633
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,644
<i>Nothing ever happens.</i>

634
00:55:51,422 --> 00:55:53,449
<i>No one ever likes me.</i>

635
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:36,665
Why do you drink every day?

636
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:45,639
What else would I do?

637
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:49,402
Should I give you something to do?

638
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:53,207
Should I give you something
to do other than drink?

639
00:56:56,515 --> 00:56:57,881
Worship me.

640
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,621
I've never felt whole before.

641
00:57:17,648 --> 00:57:20,006
One asshole after another…

642
00:57:20,088 --> 00:57:22,776
Every guy I've ever dated was an asshole.

643
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,971
So worship me and make me feel whole.

644
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:36,340
It'll be winter soon.

645
00:57:37,456 --> 00:57:39,814
Nothing survives when winter comes.

646
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:44,404
There will be nothing to see sitting there
and no work at the factory.

647
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:48,829
If you drink all day,
you'll only feel like crap.

648
00:57:50,649 --> 00:57:52,262
It'll be like hell.

649
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:57,266
You <i>have</i> to do something.

650
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:01,112
I want to feel whole for once.

651
00:58:03,635 --> 00:58:05,372
So worship me.

652
00:58:10,872 --> 00:58:12,236
Love isn't enough.

653
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:16,372
Worship me.

MY LIBERATION NOTES

659
00:59:53,268 --> 00:59:54,797
Let's at least say hi from now on.

660
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,775
I don't want to do anything with anyone.

661
00:59:57,857 --> 00:59:59,677
<i>How did the blind date go?</i>

662
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,745
…the severed head of her husband.

663
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:04,681
I stand by my man and never betray him.
I protect him.

664
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:06,584
<i>Just live alone.</i>

665
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:07,617
Should I go?

666
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,685
<i>Why wouldn't there be when he's a drunk?</i>

667
01:00:10,305 --> 01:00:11,918
<i>I was drunk and crossed the line.</i>

668
01:00:12,001 --> 01:00:13,821
<i>You and Mr. Gu are close.</i>

669
01:00:13,903 --> 01:00:15,393
<i>Have you guys even talked?</i>

670
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:18,081
<i>This crappy life with these crappy people.</i>

671
01:00:18,163 --> 01:00:19,197
Were you talking to me?

672
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:21,678
<i>I feel trapped.</i>

673
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:23,829
How about we actually do it?

674
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:28,130
-<i>So what are the three of you going to do?</i>
-I'm going to break free.

675
01:00:29,163 --> 01:00:32,058
<i>If you call Se-yeong,
you can forget about the money.</i>

676
01:00:32,141 --> 01:00:34,209
<i>You lent money to a guy, didn't you?</i>

677
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:36,236
Want me to get it back for you?

678
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,810
