MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>Damn it. It's not just us
who's been taking money on the side.</i>

4
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,921
He's raked in even more dough than us.

5
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,257
He must want to get rid of us
and keep it all to himself.

6
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,051
Chairman Shin must know that. So why?

7
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,928
<i>Why do you think he's doing nothing?</i>

8
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,933
Have it your way.

9
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,103
Yes, sir.

10
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,817
<i>I'm sure he's waiting.</i>

11
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,489
He's waiting for us to take down Baek.

12
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,282
Listen, Ja-gyeong.

13
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,535
Let's get him.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,620
<i>Come on, we can take him down together.</i>

15
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,373
Listen.

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,043
I'm…

17
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,090
completely exhausted.

18
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,401
SUPERMARKET

19
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>It's just what you say when you want
to end it with a woman, isn't it?</i>

20
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>"The woman I used to live with died."</i>

21
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>"Because of me."</i>

22
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:13,753
No! Go away!

23
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,383
You damn mutts!

24
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,638
Go! Go away! Go! I said, go!

25
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,098
Hey!

26
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,855
Hey! Get lost! Go!

27
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Goddamn mutts.

28
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,993
I told you, they're wild dogs.

29
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,153
You keep making things worse.

30
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,870
Today, I'll get my arm bit off,
and tomorrow, a broken nose.

31
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,206
Misfortunes should come in small doses,

32
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,542
but you keep stopping them
and making them bigger.

33
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,882
I'm scared every time you stop them.

34
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,677
"Now it's gotten even bigger."

35
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,221
"How bad is it going to be?"

36
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>You…</i>

37
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,578
<i>have to kill your instincts.</i>

38
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,291
<i>You have to go to the city and numb them.</i>

39
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,420
<i>So that instead of talking
about frogs being crushed to death,</i>

40
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,174
<i>you have to be able
to sincerely talk about superficial stuff</i>

41
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,927
<i>like other women do.</i>

42
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,679
<i>Until you get sick of it.</i>

43
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,558
<i>Until you're sick to death of men.</i>

44
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,897
<i>Women with sharp instincts can be scary.</i>

45
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,073
You…

46
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,913
scare me.

47
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,552
As long as you live in a place like this…

48
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,639
you won't be able to kill your instincts.

49
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,699
Gosh, I see you've had a lot to drink.

50
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:29,133
I should take a picture of us
being so chummy.

51
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,021
Gu.

52
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,148
Now we can say

53
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,984
we've watched the stars together.

54
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280
Get up.

55
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,998
SANPO SINKS

56
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,388
ALPHA RETAIL

57
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,681
<i>Is this Sanpo City Hall?</i>

58
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,349
Good afternoon.

59
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,060
I live at 748-6, Gondal-dong.

60
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,146
There are dangerous dogs
on the way to Gondal Reservoir.

61
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,148
The new product orientation
will begin now!

62
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,735
Yes, on the way to Gondal Reservoir.

63
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,988
Yes, all right.

64
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,489
-Yes, thank you.
-Sir.

65
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,949
Yes, let's go.

66
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,746
<i>Since we have new employees,</i>

67
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,207
why don't we move around
the assistant managers?

68
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,005
I think Jeong A-reum and Yeom Chang-hee
on my team should be separated.

69
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,964
Why?

70
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,800
Are they on bad terms?

71
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:58,556
Well, Yeom is
in charge of A-reum's father's store,

72
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,684
and both of them failed to get promoted
for the second time.

73
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,937
I'm afraid things will only get worse.

74
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,898
But who'd take A-reum? I'd take Yeom.

75
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,484
Yes, I'd take Yeom too.

76
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,699
<i>Let me introduce our main product
for the second half.</i>

77
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,118
<i>As you know, retro is trending right now.</i>

78
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,495
<i>So we've given our liquor a retro style.</i>

79
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>It's a collaboration with Jingwang Liquor.</i>

80
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,375
<i>It's 16.9 percent alcohol
and goes down nicely</i>

81
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,710
<i>with a refreshing taste.</i>

82
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,962
<i>Sujak, a masterpiece in the world of soju.</i>

83
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,381
<i>From the first scent to the aftertaste.</i>

84
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,175
SUJAK

85
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,846
What?

86
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,484
You can all take a bottle with you.

87
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,985
Excuse me.

88
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,112
Can I take two?

89
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,698
Why can't you catch them?

90
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,534
Those dogs run off to the mountains
when they see us.

91
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,829
They recognize the ambulance and our car.

92
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,999
They're in the middle of the field
so they can run away easily.

93
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, can't you use the tranquilizer gun?

94
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,422
We have to get close to them for that.
We can't shoot at them from that far.

95
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,760
But what's the point of setting the traps?
They won't go in.

96
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,805
They won't even go near them.
They're in the field during the day.

97
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:23,849
But at night, they roam
around the village looking for food.

98
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,560
When I see those glowing eyes in the dark…

99
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,855
Gosh. They look like wolves, you know.

100
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,734
My kids might run into them at night.
That's what I'm most afraid of.

101
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,446
Well, we'll wait for a week. If the traps
don't work, we'll call a specialist.

102
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,323
Please check the traps periodically.

103
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,866
I'm telling you, they won't.

104
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,451
Thanks anyway.

105
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,120
-Sure, have a good day.
-Goodbye.

106
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,375
SANPO SINKS

107
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,824
Damn it. He saw me.

108
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,682
Just stop by for a second.
I have something to give you.

109
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,311
At what time?

110
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,150
-Hey.
-Yes?

111
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,902
-Go sit next to A-reum.
-Yes, sir.

112
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,503
What do I do?

113
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,841
What? Is this your seat?

114
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,801
No, it's fine.

115
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,398
All right, everyone. Fill your glasses.

116
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,400
Here.

117
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,443
Cheers.

118
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,028
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

119
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,538
It looks great.

120
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,628
Who wraps it in dried laver these days?
How tacky.

121
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,799
Put it away.

122
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,176
Just eat it the way you want.

123
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,596
Clearly, you haven't had
high-quality tuna before.

124
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,099
This isn't exactly high-quality either.

125
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,433
Go on and eat.

126
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,484
What's the best way to enjoy it then?

127
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,030
Look at the meat. It's fatty.

128
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,575
This type of meat

129
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,703
tastes best
with just a little bit of wasabi.

130
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,998
Just a little bit of wasabi.

131
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,606
I said I'd treat you to a nice meal,
but you want cold noodles?

132
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,774
Let's eat something else.
I have enough money.

133
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,068
That's what I want to eat.

134
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,321
We'll have some sushi too then.

135
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,495
Why do you keep glancing at me?
Do you think he beat me?

136
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,165
Here, look. It's just fashion.

137
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,092
I had a big fight with that jerk
at his place before.

138
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,304
That asshole is so cheap.
He was all furious, but I could see

139
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,723
that he was throwing only the cheap stuff.

140
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:35,643
Things like mug cups
that cost 1,000 or 2,000 won.

141
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,312
Then he comes
and trashes my place like that.

142
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,564
He completely ruined my wallpaper.

143
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,317
The most expensive thing
in my house is the wallpaper.

144
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,111
If it gets dirty, I have to pay
500,000 won when I move out.

145
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738
It's 500,000 won.

146
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,949
Hey jerk, you better wire me the money.

147
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,952
You'd better. Before I sue you.

148
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,580
So how would you score this guy?

149
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,169
About 15 points?

150
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,671
He wasn't bad.

151
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,050
But I think 15 is too generous.

152
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,219
He's violent and he cheated on you.

153
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,472
Well…

154
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,516
He didn't make excuses.

155
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,018
When he cheated and got caught,

156
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,437
he panicked for a second
and apologized right away.

157
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,525
It's like he becomes stupid
when he gets caught doing something bad.

158
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
Like a puppy that made a mess.

159
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,197
There are a lot of crazy jerks
who do bad things

160
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,532
and blame you for it.

161
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,246
So, Mi-jeong,

162
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,331
What's your boyfriend's score?

163
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,629
I guess he's at least above 15
since he doesn't make excuses either.

164
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,965
And?

165
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,389
And? What else?

166
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,602
You'll be surprised if you see him.

167
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,271
You might think he's homeless.

168
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,566
He must be one hell of a guy.

169
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,788
Am I scary?

170
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,794
He says I scare him.

171
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,050
I guess you see right through him.

172
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,763
Just tell him to grovel.

173
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,932
You should grovel when you're scared.

174
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,144
But they always want to run away.

175
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,774
He does have some problems.

176
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,574
Since when did we care about that?

177
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,951
Even with the same person,

178
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,747
you can name a thousand reasons
to love them,

179
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,250
and a thousand reasons not to.

180
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:07,795
Look at Chang-hee.

181
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,423
He hates Jeong A-reum so much,
even for wearing circle lenses.

182
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,966
I wear them too, you know.

183
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,598
Wearing circle lenses could be
one of the thousand reasons to love me

184
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,685
and one of the thousand reasons
to hate Jeong A-reum.

185
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,897
There's no reason.

186
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,233
You just love

187
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
or hate someone because you want to.

188
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,625
Hey.

189
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,545
Here, it's alcohol.

190
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,964
It's really good.

191
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,633
I want to give it to Gu,
but I'm going to be late tonight.

192
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,097
Make sure to tell him it's from me!

193
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,986
My sister is on her way home.
I'll have to take the train.

194
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,907
Why don't you go home
with your brother then?

195
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,869
I don't take a cab
with that brat alone. It's gross.

196
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,831
Why do you always call it the train,
Ms. Yeom?

197
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,252
Like an old person.

198
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,465
What else should I call it then?

199
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,344
Doesn't everyone call it the subway?

200
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,096
It doesn't run underground in Gyeonggi.

201
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,974
Why would they dig up the ground?
The land is mostly empty.

202
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,727
Don't make it so obvious
you live in Gyeonggi.

203
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729
Just call it the subway.

204
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399
I do live in Gyeonggi.

205
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,163
Hello?

206
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,750
What are you up to? Are you off work?

207
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,044
Yes.

208
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,129
Are you on your way home?

209
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,465
No, I'm having a drink with my colleagues.

210
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,467
Where?

211
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,844
It's close by.

212
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,305
Want some octopus? You like octopus.

213
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,601
She's the one who wants it. She's just
trying to use someone else as an excuse.

214
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,727
Don't you?

215
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,606
Just tell them you're leaving
and join us here. It's fresh.

216
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,691
Tae-hun owes you a meal anyway, right?

217
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,280
Come on. My sister
cooks octopus very well.

218
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,867
Come and let's enjoy
its sweetness together.

219
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,582
Start cooking. Gi-jeong says she'll come.
And he'll pay.

220
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,336
I was going to take her
to a nice place, not here.

221
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,422
Octopus is more than
what she deserves for what she did.

222
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,008
She just picked up a record for you.

223
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,178
This is his treat.

224
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,730
I'm just trying to get your sales up.

225
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,328
What's the matter?

226
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,207
I've just been invited over for a meal.

227
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750
By that guy?

228
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,714
No.

229
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,426
By my friend, his sister.

230
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:48,265
She called and said he'd buy me
the meal he said he would tonight.

231
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,727
I'm not sure if I should go or not.

232
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,573
Hello?

233
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,577
Gyeong-seon called you without asking me

234
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,331
because she wants to eat octopus.

235
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,583
So don't worry about it.

236
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,842
Should I not come then?

237
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,680
I just thought it was rude
to invite you so abruptly.

238
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,058
I wanted to take you to a nice place.

239
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351
I mean, it's my place, so…

240
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,898
You mean, your home upstairs?

241
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,399
<i>No.</i>

242
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,443
My sister's bar.

243
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,074
Well, I don't mind.

244
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,164
I have to go. Bye.

245
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,546
It's close to here, right?

246
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,549
Yes. It's behind the food alley,
three minutes away.

247
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886
Oh, Gosh. Three minutes.
It's so close. I'm nervous.

248
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,348
Don't rush. Take your time.

249
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,522
I'm about to cross another mountain now.

250
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,483
My first encounter with the guy
who rejected me.

251
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859
You can do this.

252
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,361
I can do this.

253
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008
I don't like that lady.

254
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,761
Why not? She's my friend.

255
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,642
Is that why you don't like her?

256
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,001
Welcome.

257
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,511
Hello.

258
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,897
You're here.

259
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,024
Hello.

260
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,777
Sit, you came on a good day since there
are no customers. Let's have a drink.

261
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,070
Sure.

262
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,578
Please have a seat.

263
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,330
Okay.

264
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,503
Where's Gyeong-seon?

265
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,423
She'll be down soon.

266
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,758
I see.

267
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,261
Did you have dinner?

268
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,764
Yes.

269
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,311
What would you like to drink?

270
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,480
Beer.

271
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,191
And a bottle of soju, please.

272
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,277
-You want to mix them?
-Yes.

273
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,029
Sure.

274
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,293
I wanted to take you to a nice place.

275
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,171
This place is nice too.

276
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,341
I also like octopus.

277
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,192
All right.

278
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
Should I mix them for you?

279
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,032
-Sure.
-Right.

280
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,511
I get tipsy really quickly, you know.

281
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:41,016
So when I drink soju bombs,
I get all hyped up in ten minutes.

282
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,445
I really was going
to take you to a nice place.

283
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,240
This place is nice, really.

284
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,541
Bottoms up?

285
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,959
Okay.

286
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:24,142
In exactly ten minutes,
I'll be all hyped up and chatty.

287
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,103
Ten minutes?

288
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,482
Well, that is fast.

289
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,659
Thank you.

290
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,749
I mean it.

291
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,213
I tried to cross a mountain.

292
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,010
Thanks to you, I was able to cross it.

293
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,309
I mean, there was
this mountain in front of me.

294
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,105
And crossing it

295
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,358
has given me courage.

296
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,947
Now I want to face
the mountains one by one

297
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,491
instead of avoiding them.

298
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,452
So today…

299
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:31,459
I came here
to get over the embarrassment--

300
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,294
Why are you embarrassed?

301
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,631
I'm treating you
to thank you for the favor.

302
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,261
Thank you

303
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,221
for coming.

304
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:10,248
All right. I've had two soju bombs.
I'll become really energized now.

305
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,364
It's from my brother.

306
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,793
It's not some excuse I made up.

307
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,045
He really asked me.

308
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:00,131
I know.

309
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,675
He texted me.

310
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't you have anything to say?

311
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,324
That's a surprise.

312
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,453
You just sounded
like one of those dull women.

313
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,250
What?

314
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,378
Do you want me to apologize?

315
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,007
If you have something to say, say it.

316
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,430
Women always ask for things
like I owe them something.

317
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,932
I don't owe you anything, do I?

318
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,568
That's how life is.

319
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,280
It seems to go well
and then stabs you in the back.

320
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,743
Did you think
it was always going to be peachy?

321
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,623
Idiot.

322
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,088
It's not like I asked for a diamond.

323
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,216
It'd be easier to get you a diamond.

324
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,719
How do you worship someone?

325
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,304
I have no idea.

326
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,434
You were ready to let a dog
bite off your arm.

327
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,145
And yet, you find it hard to hold a woman?

328
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,650
You think it's cool to endure pain
with clenched teeth,

329
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,487
and it's dull to have a cute, happy life
with a woman?

330
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,657
Which is harder?

331
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,703
Getting your arm bitten off by a dog
and getting your nose broken,

332
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,580
or being nice to the woman you like?

333
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707
Which do you think is harder?

334
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,547
You treated me like a fool
who couldn't even get her money back.

335
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,758
You're no better.

336
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,178
You went to Sanpo Middle School?

337
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,806
Yes, I finished middle school in Sanpo.

338
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,767
Do you know Yeom Chang-hee, by any chance?

339
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,895
He's my younger brother.
He went to Sanpo Middle School too.

340
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,605
-Really?
-Yes.

341
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941
You're his senior.

342
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,361
He actually works near here as well.

343
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,530
He's probably drinking
somewhere around here.

344
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,949
-You should ask him to come.
-No. God, no.

345
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,909
I'd never. I'm sick of him.

346
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,454
Hello.

347
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001
What took you so long?

348
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,632
Hey, the octopus tastes great.

349
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,717
Come have a seat.

350
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,885
-You were dying to eat it.
-Yes.

351
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,610
What?

352
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,203
What happened to your hand?

353
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874
This?

354
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,418
I got hurt.

355
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,262
Hey, divorced dad. Unless you want
to be shot dead, go get me some beer.

356
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,642
Watch what you say.

357
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,937
Watch what you say,

358
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,315
or my sister will kick your ass.

359
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,988
What's with you?

360
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,077
She's my guest.

361
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,664
It was…

362
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,628
Yu-rim's birthday that day.

363
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,300
We didn't know each other then.

364
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,179
Yu-rim and I were just having dinner,
and we happened to overhear her.

365
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,266
She apologized many times afterward.
She wanted to apologize to Yu-rim too,

366
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,644
but I told her not to.

367
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,986
Oh, no! The stove!

368
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
I really left the stove on.

369
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,481
Hui-seon, I'm sorry.

370
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm sorry.

371
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:01,117
You don't have to apologize anymore.

372
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,998
Right. She didn't know any better then.

373
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,544
It's okay. Let's just drink.

374
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,509
Hui-seon and I are

375
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,055
going to take care of Yu-rim for
the rest of our lives and then die.

376
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:28,311
Her mom made another family
with another man and had…

377
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,317
Had another child.

378
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,570
We'll never let her feel betrayed
and hurt like that ever again.

379
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:44,202
We're not going to give our affection
to anyone else until the day we die.

380
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,706
We're going to die after loving
and cherishing just Yu-rim alone.

381
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624
That is

382
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,418
the only reason why I'm still alive.

383
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,715
But he won't die single like us.

384
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,092
He's seeing a woman.

385
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:03,638
I told you, I'm not.

386
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,766
I don't have anyone.

387
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,564
I don't.

388
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,025
I really don't.

389
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,613
What was that? Why are you
so concerned about what she thinks?

390
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
What's going on?

391
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,913
Do you have feelings for Gi-jeong?

392
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,795
I…

393
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,049
told him I liked him,

394
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,636
and he rejected me.

395
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,231
Yu-rim.

396
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,858
We won!

397
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,113
A very nice play from Cho Tae-hun!

398
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,115
For God's sake.

399
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,033
-We need to talk.
-No way, you prick.

400
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,285
Hey!

401
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,161
No thanks, brother.

402
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,247
Where's Chang-hee?

403
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,417
He went to the district office.
He'll be here soon.

404
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,086
A-reum's father apparently
keeps giving him errands.

405
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,965
He should take care of
his own business with the district office.

406
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,217
Does he think
the HQ employees are his butlers?

407
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,681
Just between you and me.

408
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,768
I'm trying to separate
A-reum and Chang-hee,

409
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:17,021
but no one wants to take A-reum.

410
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,316
So I'm thinking,
how about you and Chang-hee switch teams?

411
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:24,945
You want me

412
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,573
to sit next to A-reum?

413
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:28,991
Yes.

414
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,578
Gosh.

415
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,914
What?

416
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,499
It could be different with you.

417
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,500
Why don't we

418
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,127
wait and see for a while?

419
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,296
Chang-hee seems okay these days.

420
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:46,300
He didn't even complain about going
to the district office. He was smiling.

421
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,637
I mean, he used to throw
a tantrum over things like that.

422
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,307
But today, he just smiled and said,
"I'll see you later."

423
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,851
He does seem different, doesn't he?

424
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,104
Is he dating someone?

425
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,690
I don't think so.

426
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,318
-Here.
-Hey.

427
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
Man, it's hot.

428
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,906
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

429
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,449
No, I just got here.

430
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,577
Look at you.

431
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,163
-I'm okay.
-What do you want to eat?

432
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,041
I'll just have the ox bone soup.

433
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:20,876
You?

434
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,503
Same.

435
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,090
-Excuse me. Three ox bone soup, please.
-Where's the cup?

436
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,261
What is it?

437
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,973
It can't be a girl.

438
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,061
You're not going to tell me?

439
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,570
A few days ago,

440
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,489
I almost died trying to hold in my poop.

441
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,743
It was right about to come out so I had
to barge into my neighbor's house.

442
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,287
The guy who works for your dad?

443
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,122
-Yes.
-The one that jumped that long distance?

444
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,791
Yes! It was so freaking cool.

445
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,627
I didn't even have time
to turn the lights on,

446
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,421
but the power was out anyway.

447
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,426
<i>So I was sitting in the dark,</i>

448
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,305
<i>and I saw something glimmering
next to my butt.</i>

449
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,891
<i>It was a bidet.</i>

450
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,935
<i>I thought, "This guy uses a bidet."</i>

451
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,522
<i>"Of course. I'm sure he used to be rich."</i>

452
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,777
<i>He seemed like a guy who used to be rich.
I just had the feeling.</i>

453
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,573
<i>Then I saw something else in front of me.</i>

454
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,992
<i>I was like, "Is it a glowing watch?"</i>

455
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:41,540
<i>No, it was a key to a Royce, my dream car.</i>

456
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,585
<i>The moment I saw it,</i>

457
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,463
<i>I could picture his past at once.</i>

458
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,632
<i>A man who fell from the very top.</i>

459
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,968
<i>A man who doesn't care where
he puts the key to his luxury car.</i>

460
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,429
<i>My savior.</i>

461
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,605
I don't know why, but I wanted
to get close to him. I just did.

462
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,357
It's like my soul knew.

463
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,567
"Cling to him. Grovel, Chang-hee."

464
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,361
And I really groveled.

465
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,947
Well, you know I'm good at it.

466
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:16,325
But to him, I just shut up and groveled.

467
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,827
I don't know his age,
but I treat him like he's older.

468
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,205
How great are my animal instincts?

469
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,547
He likes me too, you know.

470
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,215
If I go…

471
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,384
"Hey."

472
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:39,139
"Your car that you just ditched somewhere.
Can I drive it?"

473
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,392
He'll let me.

474
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,310
I'm 100 percent sure.

475
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,318
What if he only has the key?

476
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,000
You want to ruin it, right?
Okay, I get it.

477
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,218
<i>Since that day, what A-reum says
doesn't bother me anymore.</i>

478
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,931
<i>She's just too trivial
to ruin my saintly mood.</i>

479
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,852
<i>I've tried everything to not hate her.
Meditation, Buddhist chants…</i>

480
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,061
<i>None of them worked.</i>

481
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,316
<i>I thought, "When you hate someone,
you just can't help it."</i>

482
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,444
<i>But what I needed was
something beyond mere willpower.</i>

483
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:43,621
<i>I use his bathroom every morning and night
to check on the key.</i>

484
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,965
Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.

485
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,302
What?

486
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,973
It's good, isn't it?

487
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,564
Good night, then.

488
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:19,281
<i>I hope he and Mi-jeong make up soon
so I can bring it up.</i>

489
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,702
<i>Mi-jeong, I'm counting on you.</i>

490
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,329
<i>Throw yourself at him!</i>

491
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:51,689
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

492
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,196
<i>I told you,</i>

493
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:04,535
<i>I don't care if you're
a notorious criminal or even an alien.</i>

494
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328
<i>So what's the big deal?</i>

495
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,168
<i>I still think you're okay.</i>

496
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,504
<i>So let's carry on.</i>

497
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,339
<i>Let's keep going.</i>

498
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,436
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

499
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,728
<i>It's now chilly…</i>

500
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,315
<i>in the morning.</i>

501
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,261
I don't get why you'd ask a man
for dating advice.

502
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:08,432
Shouldn't you ask another woman
for that sort of thing?

503
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:14,480
To me, it looks like an excuse
to make a move on him.

504
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,859
Am I overreacting here?

505
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,195
No, you're not.

506
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,697
I'm sorry.

507
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,117
You're absolutely right.
I don't know what to say.

508
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369
I'm so embarrassed.

509
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,080
Please try to understand
how it makes me feel.

510
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,209
Because you and Mr. Park seem so close,

511
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,337
people are starting to wonder
if he and I have broken up.

512
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,173
I'm really sorry.

513
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,050
I'll be careful.

514
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,305
I'm really sorry.

515
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,391
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

516
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,692
Why are you crying?

517
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,861
Now you're making me feel bad.

518
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,404
No, I…

519
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,407
I'm just so ashamed of myself.

520
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,536
I just embarrass myself every day.

521
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,046
But you have nothing
to worry about though.

522
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,173
I'm not Mr. Park's type.

523
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,426
He didn't even give me
any lottery tickets.

524
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,886
That's right.

525
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,362
What did Ms. Yeom say?

526
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,241
She said she just became close
with Mr. Park

527
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,993
while asking for dating advice.

528
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,139
Did you two have sweet dreams?

529
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,914
Maybe she just made up the whole story.

530
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,722
-Really?
-Yes.

531
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,433
You two seem to
be very interested in your looks.

532
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:52,429
<i>Nirvana reminds me of you now.</i>

533
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,726
<i>I'd like to buy you two meals
as an apology</i>

534
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,102
<i>without Gyeong-seon.</i>

535
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:00,729
<i>Please, let me.</i>

536
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,534
Hey.

537
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,744
Hey!

538
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,209
Hello, sir. It's been a long time.

539
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,960
"Export investments
in the second-quarter slump."

540
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,091
"The economy is in a recession
for the fifth straight month."

541
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,593
"This is the longest recession

542
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,805
since the government started giving
monthly economic reports in March, 2005."

543
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,766
"The recession in the real economy is

544
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,351
continuing due to the difficulties
in foreign trade,

545
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:07,522
but the government believes that it is
not a sign of economic stagnation."

546
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,984
What are you doing?

547
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,368
My partner is a man of few words.

548
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,413
He says nothing all day.

549
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,586
So I've become a slow talker.

550
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,088
I even stutter now.

551
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,593
It's been a while,
so I didn't want to stutter and look bad.

552
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,477
I wasn't able to sleep for days.

553
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,771
I was too angry.

554
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,236
I thought about what made me so angry.

555
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,865
What are you doing here? Are you putting
on a show? Acting like you're broken?

556
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,744
You think I'd put on a show?

557
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,460
Why do I have to act like I'm broken?

558
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,587
Tell me.

559
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,756
I'm taking a break.

560
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,718
For 15 years, I listened
to the drunks yapping

561
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,554
and singing in basements like this.

562
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,599
Then I went home to…

563
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,107
I was practically a dead man walking.
I was barely alive.

564
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,610
But you saved my life

565
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,863
by stabbing me in the back.

566
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,409
Thanks.

567
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,537
You asshole.
You're talking down to me now?

568
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,789
Then what? You stabbed me in the back.

569
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,886
I'm a little busy these days,

570
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,597
making sinks and stuff.

571
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,976
I'll come back if I decide to.

572
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,357
Do I decide that I like making sinks
and want to leave this world behind,

573
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,528
or do I decide that this is the world
that I need to conquer?

574
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:19,863
It's one or the other.

575
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,283
I'll be back after
I make the decision, so just wait.

576
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,538
If you keep lurking around
and pissing me off,

577
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,459
I will come back for good,
so just wait quietly.

578
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,132
Got it?

579
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,757
Hey, you need a new sink.

580
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,844
Sam-sik!

581
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,223
Sam-sik!

582
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,559
Sam-sik!

583
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,146
That son of a bitch. I should just…

584
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,152
Order one from Sanpo Sinks.

585
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,821
I…

586
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:45,907
I've changed my name.

587
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:59,671
I'm not the one who texted you
to come to Oido Station that winter.

588
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,134
Mr. Baek had borrowed my cell phone then.

589
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,971
I wouldn't dare to tell you
to come there to drink with me.

590
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,180
I know.

591
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Hyeon-jin told me.

592
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:17,439
SANPO SINKS

593
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,760
Go ahead, guys.

594
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,339
Let's go before the traffic hits.

595
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:31,471
Did…

596
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,848
Did that guy go home already?

597
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,019
Your boss who always throws a fit.

598
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,434
Looks like they made up, right?

599
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,824
What do you think you're doing?
Don't follow me.

600
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,872
Go back.

601
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:08,920
Go away.

602
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,717
You punk. I said, go away.

603
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,344
You little…

604
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,915
I will die if you tell me

605
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,168
that it's just the key you have.

606
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,171
I really want

607
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,008
to live as a saint for a while.

608
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,679
Even if you don't have the car,
please say you do.

609
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:04,976
Please tell me you'll give it to me
when the time comes.

610
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:11,274
Please. I want to feel this way
for a little longer.

611
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,216
Listen.

612
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,219
I…

613
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,891
just came back from Seoul.

614
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,520
And you want me to go back?

615
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,503
Gu.

616
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,506
I love you.

617
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,603
Really?

618
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:45,386
Gu.

619
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,055
Gu!

620
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:52,143
Gosh, thank you. I love you.
