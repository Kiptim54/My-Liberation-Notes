MY LIBERATION NOTES

MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:07,904 --> 00:00:09,529
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,281
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:21,970
Your drink is ready.

6
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:27,760
Thank you. Come again.

7
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:30,737
So I joined the tango club,
and I was appalled.

8
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,343
You can hear people breathing up close.

9
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,286
Why do people breathe so loudly?

10
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,347
My boss put his hand on my shoulder,

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,001
and it was hot and sweaty.

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,855
In table tennis, there's sweat everywhere.

13
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:44,840
It just spatters everywhere.

14
00:00:44,922 --> 00:00:46,783
When my boss got in the elevator with me,

15
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:48,892
I pulled back without even realizing it.

16
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:52,201
I can still feel all the moistness
I felt on that day.

17
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:56,171
Sweating with your colleagues
is not the way to go.

18
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,480
Musical and theater clubs are the best.

19
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:01,134
You can just enjoy the show.

20
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,904
The problem with those clubs
is the meet-up after.

21
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:05,931
How you feel about the show
should be up to you.

22
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,329
But they always
force their opinions on you.

23
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:11,017
If I say I enjoyed it,
they say it was boring.

24
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,341
It drives me crazy.

25
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:16,477
I mean, can't we separate the clubs
into older and younger groups?

26
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,544
Right? Can't someone suggest it?

27
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,612
Then the higher-ups will be upset.

28
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:21,522
You think?

29
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,259
What's it like in your clubs?

30
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:24,747
It's mostly people in their forties.

31
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,229
How about yours, Mi-jeong?

32
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,082
She's not a part of any, remember?

33
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,778
That's right, she doesn't do any.

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,018
Not even one?

35
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,500
Why? They cover all the costs.

36
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,360
Many sign up for two or three of them.

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,553
You know…

38
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,323
I'm just not interested.

39
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,433
Hey, you think we do it because we are?

40
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,211
You go to have fun!

41
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,485
And if you can get a date out of it,
even better.

42
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:52,745
It takes me three seconds
to realize there's no one there for me.

43
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,151
Nine times out of ten.

44
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,467
Most of the time, seriously.

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,361
But there's always that one chance

46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,678
that you might meet someone.

47
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,440
That's why it's worth going to
ten different clubs.

48
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:08,170
Come with me today.

49
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,231
Just come, okay?

50
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,333
You can do it! Just one more!

51
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,152
Haven't you joined any clubs?

52
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,923
Why not? There are many good clubs.

53
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:31,825
I live quite far away.

54
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:33,190
Where do you live?

55
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:35,092
In Sanpo.

56
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:37,243
Is that by Yongin?

57
00:02:37,326 --> 00:02:38,566
It's near Suwon.

58
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,040
Good luck, sir!

59
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,322
You got this, boss!

60
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:50,725
Nice!

61
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,883
Well done.

62
00:03:17,317 --> 00:03:18,887
You can do it!

63
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,335
-You can do it!
-You can do it!

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,614
<i>Looks like I'll be late today.</i>

65
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,321
JUNE 21ST

66
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:34,230
Let's go!

67
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,118
Hey, I can drink more.
I'm taking a cab home today.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,227
-Will Mi-jeong be late too?
-Yes.

69
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,836
<i>I'll be late too.
Meet me at Gangnam Station at 12.</i>

70
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:51,392
You got this!

71
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,059
Let's just talk about it face to face.

72
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,747
Our whole relationship
has been over texts.

73
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:24,022
Even all of our fights were through texts.

74
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:25,965
You want to break up through a text too?

75
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:30,474
At least when we break up, I want
to say it loudly right to your face.

76
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,128
I'll be waiting.

77
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,484
I said, I'll be waiting!

78
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:39,447
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

79
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,681
<i>I'll be late too.</i>

80
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,560
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

81
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:57,644
-You're so good at bowling.
-Are you sure you're not pro?

82
00:04:57,726 --> 00:04:59,545
Gosh, you're so good at bowling.

83
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:00,952
You were incredible.

84
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,854
-You were amazing.
-You're really good.

85
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,095
You even got a strike.

86
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,832
How are you so cool?

87
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,230
-Everything you tossed out was a strike.
-No.

88
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,979
-I know, right?
-You're so good at it.

89
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,618
I can't get my form right.

90
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:22,663
Are you leaving? Stay a bit longer.

91
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,318
It's late.

92
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,750
I'll head out first.

93
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,363
You're leaving already?

94
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,431
I need to catch the last train.

95
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,003
She lives far away.

96
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,739
Where was it again?

97
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,145
You should move closer.

98
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,833
Doesn't our company offer
a housing subsidy?

99
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,198
It's only ten million won.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,480
-That's it?
-Yes.

101
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:43,465
All right, cheers.

102
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,416
Where are you?

103
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,154
Hello.

104
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,560
You came pretty early.

105
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,669
It's been ages. Seeing anyone these days?

106
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,936
Another beer glass
and a pair of chopsticks, please.

107
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:15,887
Sure.

108
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,684
He asked where I lived.

109
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,241
I said I live in Gyeonggi-do,
so it didn't matter where we met in Seoul.

110
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:26,763
I told him to pick a place
that worked best for him.

111
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,087
I did say that.

112
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,422
But shouldn't he at least have asked
where in Gyeonggi-do I live in?

113
00:06:33,505 --> 00:06:35,076
But he went, "Really?"

114
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,854
Then he said to meet in Samcheong.

115
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,302
Can you believe that?

116
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:42,190
Anyway, so I followed Route 1
all the way up,

117
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:43,761
crossing the Han River.

118
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,739
This guy clearly has no idea
what Gyeonggi-do even looks like.

119
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:48,682
I went all the way up there, but…

120
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:49,799
Jeez, I'm tearing up.

121
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,866
Hey, where can you buy a gun in Korea?

122
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,562
A slap in his face won't cut it.

123
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,712
I should just put three bullets in him.

124
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:01,337
Do you know what it's like for me
to go to Seoul on the weekend too?

125
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:03,736
How could they set me up
with someone like that?

126
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:06,051
Being divorced, I don't care about.

127
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,623
It's no big deal these days.

128
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:11,262
I would even be jealous. I might
even be okay if he's been married twice.

129
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:14,157
But come on, he has a kid!

130
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,078
Nothing's more precious to you
than your own kid.

131
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:22,345
But that kid means nothing to me
since it's not my kid.

132
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:25,033
We already have
such a huge thing dividing us.

133
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,639
A woman and a man
are trying to live together,

134
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,574
but if their priorities are different,
how could that ever work?

135
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,240
Hey.

136
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:39,590
His kid is an eighth-grader.
You know what they're like.

137
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:43,850
You can't tell if they are animals
or a malfunctioning cyborg…

138
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,511
A lot of people who already have kids
marry each other and live happily.

139
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,696
They recognize
the importance of each other's kids

140
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:00,929
and care for them…

141
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,329
Why should I not say anything?

142
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:30,870
Did you two fight?

143
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,025
How could you be
like this on her birthday?

144
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:45,510
Did your mom give you anything?

145
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:50,845
Come on, eat up.

146
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,146
Look at me.
Do I look like I haven't eaten yet?

147
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:00,977
What did your mom give you?

148
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,169
Didn't she give you anything?

149
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,203
She did.

150
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,725
Then why aren't you telling me
what she gave you?

151
00:09:08,876 --> 00:09:10,324
I asked her for money.

152
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:20,580
Happy birthday.

153
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:23,474
They're earphones. Expensive ones.

154
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,328
Thank you.

155
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:28,850
Thanks for being born.

156
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:31,662
Thank you, truly.

157
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:36,832
Who do your Auntie Hui-seon
and I have but you?

158
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,305
When we're old and lonely,
I'm glad we'll have someone to call.

159
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:42,208
Hey, don't worry.

160
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:46,964
I won't bother you too much.
I'll try to kick the bucket in one go.

161
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,520
-I got it.
-I'm just relieved.

162
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,490
I'm glad to have you.
You're like insurance.

163
00:09:56,104 --> 00:10:00,529
When you were born, you were so little.
I couldn't believe you were actually real.

164
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:03,836
When did you get this big?
When did you turn into a whole person?

165
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:08,635
By the way, do you usually speak
this quietly in a barbecue restaurant?

166
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:15,333
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

167
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,048
-I feel terrible, I drank too much.
-Right.

168
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,867
Hey, it's late, let's go.

169
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,150
Yes, it's late.

170
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:51,809
Go.

171
00:10:59,956 --> 00:11:01,113
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,174
Pick it up for her, will you?

173
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,911
A beer, please!

174
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,392
Where is he?

175
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,167
Thank you.

176
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,276
I may have gotten divorced…

177
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,032
but the best decision I ever made

178
00:11:23,859 --> 00:11:24,810
was getting married.

179
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:30,559
How else would I have met
such a precious kid?

180
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:49,582
How do you know him?

181
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:52,105
From work.

182
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,379
Then you should've said hi sooner.

183
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:57,563
I just know his face.
We're not on the same team.

184
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:14,312
Jo Yu-rim!

185
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,166
Did you eat the seaweed soup
I made for you this morning?

186
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:20,143
You call that soup? It was so thick
that I couldn't get the ladle in.

187
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,237
What did Auntie Gyeong-seon get you?

188
00:12:26,306 --> 00:12:28,745
That looks expensive.

189
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,895
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

190
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,843
We're already here. Hurry up.

191
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,076
<i>I'm on my way. I'll be there soon!</i>

192
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,750
I can't believe him.

193
00:12:47,728 --> 00:12:49,092
YEOM GI-JEONG

194
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,814
So you were messaging me
and that guy at the same time?

195
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,386
At one in the morning, at that!

196
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:57,901
You don't do that? Everyone texts
more than two people all the time.

197
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,589
Not when I'm texting my lover
at one in the morning.

198
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,897
I don't text my lover "I miss you too"
when it's meant for someone else

199
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,262
and then delete it.

200
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:10,183
I don't send a bunch of heart emojis
and LOLs to others while texting my lover.

201
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:13,450
Did I meet him in person
and flirt or something?

202
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:16,138
You know you have to
be more friendly in messages.

203
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,653
You can't tell if words are being said
with a smile or a serious look.

204
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:22,755
That's why I stick a LOL
at the end of everything.

205
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:23,913
Don't you do that?

206
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:27,883
Is that why you told him
you missed him, then?

207
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:29,330
To be friendly?

208
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:31,109
What's wrong with saying I miss him?

209
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:35,244
I miss BTS.
I miss my grandma. I miss my uncle.

210
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,609
I miss a lot of people.

211
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:40,206
Don't you miss anyone?
Don't you ever tell people you miss them?

212
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,564
Don't you know
"I miss you" means "I love you"?

213
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,087
Only to you.

214
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,617
It only means that to you!

215
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,230
Try asking people!

216
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,835
If a man and a woman say
they miss each other at night

217
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,324
means anything or not.

218
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,391
I told you to wait, please!

219
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,963
Sure, fine, let's ask.

220
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:57,039
Who should we ask?

221
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:58,858
-Go on, ask someone!
-Seriously.

222
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:03,407
You're worried about the cab fare
even in this situation, aren't you?

223
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,427
You asked to meet here
because of that too.

224
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,700
-Yes.
-Do you want to end things like that?

225
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:10,272
Yes, absolutely.

226
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:12,670
What's wrong with
meeting in the middle for once?

227
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:16,268
I went to your neighborhood
to see you every time.

228
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:18,171
Do you know how far it is from my home?

229
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:21,438
I had to spend another hour and a half
just to get home.

230
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,416
That's your problem.
Who told you to live so far away?

231
00:14:29,543 --> 00:14:31,735
Then does he live in Seoul?

232
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:35,913
Let me ask you one thing.

233
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:40,007
Does he even know that you have a lover?

234
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:45,135
-He knows I have a boyfriend.
-Is a boyfriend not a lover?

235
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:51,131
Who uses the word "lover" these days?
It's so lame.

236
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:53,736
Even people born in the 70s
don't say that.

237
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,011
Ask around if people still use that word.

238
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:57,789
You know what?

239
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,766
You are unbearably old-fashioned. Really.

240
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,157
Disgustingly old-fashioned!

241
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,844
We're home.

242
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:09,794
We're home.

243
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,003
Keep it down!

244
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,646
Hey.

245
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,334
That guy was telling us off earlier,
wasn't he?

246
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,395
It was our mistake.

247
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,917
How were we to know?

248
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,526
Apologize and give him
a gift certificate for me.

249
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,346
I'll give it to you later.

250
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:13,895
That's too much.

251
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:17,872
-Where are you going?
-To get my hair done.

252
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:20,767
You say you're tired every morning
but you're going out again?

253
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,579
-You should rest on the weekend.
-As if anyone would let me.

254
00:20:25,936 --> 00:20:28,252
I'll die if I work in the field
on a day like today.

255
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:34,745
Go and pretend you're helping at least.

256
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,219
Don't just sit around all day
until your dad tears into you.

257
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:42,520
Don't you feel bad
that your old man has been out

258
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,670
working under the sun all day?

259
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,054
I was going to go help him.

260
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,184
Hey, Dad.

261
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:19,793
I have something to tell you.

262
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,226
Just eat your food quietly.

263
00:23:36,046 --> 00:23:36,997
I mean…

264
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:40,305
I'm not asking for help or anything.

265
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:43,490
I just want your permission.
An "okay" or something like that.

266
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:47,915
I'm…

267
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:50,851
thinking of buying a car.

268
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:01,603
It's an electric car.

269
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:05,573
Electric cars don't cost that much.
It's only 7,000 won to fully charge it.

270
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,600
They say 50,000 won is enough per month.

271
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,088
If it's 50,000 won a month,

272
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,694
that's a lot cheaper
than taking the bus or the train.

273
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,134
And second-hand cars
don't even cost that much.

274
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,145
Don't you remember
the last time you bought a car

275
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:19,634
and put yourself through hell?

276
00:24:20,213 --> 00:24:21,495
Back then, I--

277
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,555
You couldn't even afford it,
but you bought it on an installment plan.

278
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:26,747
So I had no choice but to help you.

279
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,070
But you're at it again?

280
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:31,173
What I'm saying is
I didn't know any better then.

281
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,661
I do now.

282
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:36,135
My expenses, budget, my spending habits…
I know all that stuff now.

283
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:39,071
So I'm planning
to get a small electric car.

284
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,628
Don't just say no without considering it.

285
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,868
Just hear me out.

286
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:47,011
It's a car, it's not like
it's some luxury item.

287
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:50,155
And I'm not buying it
so I can show off to anyone.

288
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,883
I mean, how can I?
They don't even go fast.

289
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,868
Look.

290
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,087
If Mi-jeong, Gi-jeong, and I stay out late
and take a taxi home, that's 30,000 won.

291
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,072
With an electric car,
it'll cost 3,000 won,

292
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,850
but we're paying 30,000 won for it.

293
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,012
Dad, come on, I mean…

294
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,328
I'm not being unreasonable here.

295
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:12,941
If you think about it, I'm right.

296
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:14,802
An electric car is cheaper.

297
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:17,490
Don't just say no
because it's a car, please.

298
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:19,392
How much is it?

299
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,238
Like I said, it's a cheap one.

300
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:25,678
In installments again?

301
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,494
Dad.

302
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,976
I…

303
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,830
don't have a car

304
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,021
and I live in Gyeonggi-do.

305
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:58,349
How am I supposed to get married
let alone date anyone?

306
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:02,815
All of the magic happens inside a car,
but I don't have one, Dad!

307
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,387
Where can I kiss a girl?

308
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:17,041
Why are you being like this again?

309
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,192
Seriously…

310
00:26:20,474 --> 00:26:22,873
I don't want to keep
any secrets from you, Dad.

311
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,470
I really don't want
to hide anything at all from you.

312
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:30,151
Honestly, I could buy a car secretly,
hide it anywhere I wanted

313
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:31,888
and act like I never bought one.

314
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:34,162
But I don't want to do that, okay?

315
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,726
I don't want to hide
anything at all from you.

316
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:38,256
I never have.

317
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:40,696
I wish you would.

318
00:26:41,896 --> 00:26:44,749
Please hide it from me.

319
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:49,671
Come on.

320
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,292
That punk, I ought to…

321
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,021
I told him to keep his mouth shut
at the dinner table.

322
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,014
Goodness.

323
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:21,762
Tell him your dad will start
at seven tomorrow,

324
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,954
but he can come by nine.

325
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:25,897
Don't just tell him to come by nine.

326
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,875
Then he'll know what you mean
and come early.

327
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:34,086
Why do we have to walk
on eggshells around someone we hired.

328
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:40,206
That brat, one of these days…

329
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:47,237
I ought to just…

330
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:12,464
They said you can come by nine tomorrow.

331
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:49,063
{\an8}I'm going to sue that salon.

332
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:04,778
{\an8}<i>On the street that the nun walks across</i>

333
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:12,552
{\an8}<i>My old friend pretends
He doesn't even know me</i>

334
00:29:12,636 --> 00:29:14,827
{\an8}-<i>Like how they sell cigarettes</i>
-Don't wash your hair.

335
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:16,191
{\an8}Your curls will come undone.

336
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:20,038
{\an8}-That's why I'm washing it.
-<i>At a local pharmacy</i>

337
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:23,512
{\an8}<i>-The world carries on peacefully</i>
-What a waste of money.

338
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:26,489
{\an8}<i>It goes its own way</i>

339
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,542
{\an8}-<i>Bustling down the street</i>
-<i>I'm currently working two jobs.</i>

340
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:33,354
{\an8}I'm a soccer coach at an elementary school

341
00:29:33,437 --> 00:29:35,091
{\an8}and I also run a coffee shop.

342
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:40,301
{\an8}If I'm being honest, it's just one job.
The cafe went bankrupt.

343
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:43,445
{\an8}<i>On that roadside</i>

344
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,471
{\an8}-<i>Where time breathes
-Actually…</i>

345
00:29:45,554 --> 00:29:47,415
{\an8}what I love most is singing.

346
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:50,640
{\an8}To be able to support myself
with my singing is my dream.

347
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:55,065
{\an8}<i>Without anybody knowing</i>

348
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:59,325
{\an8}<i>I walked around crying</i>

349
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,310
{\an8}I like this kind of song.

350
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,792
{\an8}I can do louder music too.

351
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:10,905
{\an8}<i>Looking down the street
From the second floor</i>

352
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:18,142
<i>It was a peaceful street, yeah</i>

353
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:20,292
If you're done, bring the dishes.

354
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,146
<i>-Looking down the street
-Looking down the street</i>

355
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:27,075
<i>-From the second floor
-From the second floor</i>

356
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,368
<i>-There was nothing but a thick fog
-There was nothing but a thick fog</i>

357
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,319
Damn it!

358
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:36,008
This song's so old.
This is why you were rejected, dumbass.

359
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,000
Jeez.

360
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,617
Have you ever felt

361
00:30:44,196 --> 00:30:46,594
an unbearable kind of humiliation?

362
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:51,722
As soon as we said goodbye
after the blind date,

363
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:53,376
she started sending a bunch of texts.

364
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:55,733
She said

365
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:58,132
I was an abandoned dog.

366
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:04,212
She said that if she took me home
and cleaned me up,

367
00:31:04,294 --> 00:31:06,858
I'd just go back outside
and get covered in poop again.

368
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,185
She thought she was there alone
with her friend,

369
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:15,088
not knowing I was there.

370
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:20,506
She kept going about how upset she was
and then said "OMG!"

371
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,952
Then she left the room.

372
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:26,791
She could've
at least deleted her messages.

373
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:29,066
You should just leave too.

374
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,010
That's even more humiliating.

375
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,303
You idiot!

376
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:41,844
But I must endure this.

377
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,656
Deleting it
won't make me forget what happened.

378
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:47,097
I just have to bear it.

379
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:48,999
Here.

380
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:51,150
Delete it for me and leave the chatroom.

381
00:31:56,153 --> 00:31:56,980
Du-hwan.

382
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,466
Thanks…

383
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,519
for one-upping me.

384
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,177
Ye-rin told me…

385
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:19,312
I was unbearably old-fashioned.

386
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,873
The abandoned dog wins.

387
00:32:31,802 --> 00:32:33,208
Hey, someone please one-up me.

388
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,324
Mi-jeong.

389
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:38,005
You have to beat me, okay? Please.

390
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:47,351
She knows exactly what words
to use to hurt my feelings.

391
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:52,148
As an abandoned dog,

392
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,746
I don't think
being called old-fashioned is that bad.

393
00:32:57,152 --> 00:32:59,592
That's because you just are
an old-fashioned person.

394
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:03,066
And I'm a person who may
or may not be, and that's why it hurts.

395
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:07,201
Do you know
what she said about Gyeonggi-do?

396
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,013
She said Gyeonggi-do's like an egg white.

397
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:13,033
An egg white that wraps around Seoul.

398
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,601
I told her I live in Sanpo many times,
but she had no idea where Sanpo was.

399
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:23,909
Or whether I take Line One or Line Four.

400
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:26,846
She said it was because
she would never live in Gyeonggi-do.

401
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,650
If you like someone,

402
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:34,289
the first thing you do is
look up where they live.

403
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:38,094
It doesn't have to be New York,

404
00:33:39,128 --> 00:33:41,278
but if I had been born in Seoul…

405
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,384
Why did I have to be born
in an egg white, of all places?

406
00:33:54,223 --> 00:33:56,125
If we had lived in Seoul,

407
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,730
would we have been any different?

408
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:02,121
We would have.

409
00:34:03,362 --> 00:34:04,726
I agree with him.

410
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:29,788
SANPO SINKS

411
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:29,339
Will you stop it already?

412
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:31,365
You've been crying all night
since you got home last night.

413
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:33,557
And there you go again
as soon as you wake up.

414
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,874
I'm having a hard time, all right?

415
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:38,644
You think you're the only one?
What about her?

416
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,208
She's still young!

417
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:48,487
Fate is nothing more
than a person's outlook on life.

418
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:27,443
Hey.

419
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,097
Have you eaten?

420
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,862
SANPO
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

421
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:11,528
DANGMI STATION

422
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:44,694
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

423
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,372
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

424
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:55,570
WINNER JOY BASEBALL CLUB
JOY CARD HORSE RIDING CLUB

425
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:57,804
<i>I heard you went to the bowling club.</i>

426
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,458
<i>How was it?</i>

427
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,567
It was good, wasn't it?

428
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,082
People tend not to drop out
of that club once they join.

429
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:07,398
Members tend to be
quite satisfied with that club.

430
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,012
What do you say?

431
00:38:09,094 --> 00:38:11,245
Would you like to join them
starting this month?

432
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:19,557
Or would you rather
try a few more before you decide?

433
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:23,610
Do I

434
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,422
have to join a club?

435
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,434
Well, it's not compulsory,

436
00:38:31,964 --> 00:38:34,320
but work life isn't really
anything special, is it?

437
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:38,662
No matter what job it is,
after six months, it becomes mundane.

438
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,716
But it's a lot better
when you get along with others.

439
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:44,990
It also increases productivity.

440
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,404
Did you not join a club either?

441
00:38:58,968 --> 00:38:59,795
No.

442
00:39:05,337 --> 00:39:07,363
Are we under special care or something?

443
00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:16,254
Can't they just leave
introverted people alone?

444
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:32,963
I have a daughter who's in fourth grade.

445
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:37,181
I have to go home early
and take care of her.

446
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,433
So I will join a club later

447
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:44,707
when things become more manageable.

448
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:55,749
Here you go.

449
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,321
AUTUMN TRIP

450
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:58,892
Okay. Thank you.

451
00:40:10,802 --> 00:40:12,167
<i>Everyone.</i>

452
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:15,889
<i>Assistant Manager Mr. Min suggested
we should go to Euljiro today!</i>

453
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:19,156
<i>I'm all for it!</i>

454
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:21,802
<i>Can I eat to my heart's content?</i>

455
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,581
<i>I'll just eat a little.</i>

456
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:24,946
<i>I love you.</i>

457
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,013
<i>Is everyone in?</i>

458
00:40:27,096 --> 00:40:28,874
-<i>Yes!</i>
-<i>I'm in, too!</i>

459
00:40:28,957 --> 00:40:29,784
<i>Yes!</i>

460
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,454
<i>Mi-jeong, I know you've read these.
Why aren't you replying?</i>

461
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,029
HEHEHE

462
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,254
<i>It's too far for me
to get back home from Euljiro.</i>

463
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:57,161
<i>How can you spend
every day of your youth going home?</i>

464
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:06,260
This isn't right.

465
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:07,211
CHOI JUN-HO

466
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:09,196
No, that's not right.

467
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:16,474
That's not right.

468
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:20,899
Neither is this.

469
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:23,381
Up to here, the color's…

470
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:27,061
This needs to be lower, in bold,
and highlighted.

471
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:37,028
INCREASE THE FONT TO HERE

472
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,061
BRING IT DOWN FURTHER

473
00:41:39,385 --> 00:41:41,080

00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:49,765
CHANGE THE COLOR

478
00:41:50,798 --> 00:41:51,998
REDO ALL THE COLORS

479
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:34,387
<i>If I imagine that I'm sitting here
working next to you,</i>

480
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:37,985
<i>even awful tasks like these
turn into something beautiful.</i>

481
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:40,053
<i>Work becomes bearable.</i>

482
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,718
<i>I'm playing a role
of a woman who is loved.</i>

483
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,530
<i>A woman who has everything she needs.</i>

484
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,467
<i>Right now, I love someone,</i>

485
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,369
<i>and that someone is supporting me.</i>

486
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:57,794
<i>So I want to imagine I'm at peace.</i>

487
00:42:58,745 --> 00:43:02,550
<i>That I'm already enjoying the good times
that I'll be spending with you.</i>

488
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,031
<i>That's how I want to think of it.</i>

489
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:10,076
<i>Rather than going through exhausting,
difficult times without you,</i>

490
00:43:10,697 --> 00:43:15,370
<i>isn't it more admirable that
I'm finding strength thinking of you?</i>

491
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,213
I know a dried pollack place.

492
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:27,776
-Dried pollack?
-Sounds good to me.

493
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:30,010
I'm in a good mood. Let's go!

494
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,003
Great!

495
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:34,931
Try to find someone
to set up with Mi-jeong.

496
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,330
I don't really know anyone.

497
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:41,093
From a woman's perspective,
Mi-jeong is so pretty and kind.

498
00:43:41,176 --> 00:43:43,119
I don't get
why she doesn't have a boyfriend.

499
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:46,304
Yes, she's pretty. Sure.

500
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:49,777
When you look at
each of her features individually, she is.

501
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:51,225
But?

502
00:43:51,886 --> 00:43:54,244
As a whole, she's quite bland.

503
00:43:54,823 --> 00:43:56,435
She doesn't have that something special.

504
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,440
<i>If we had lived in Seoul,</i>

505
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:15,914
<i>would we have been different?</i>

506
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:19,677
We would have.

507
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:24,475
No matter where I lived…

508
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,907
I think I would have been the same.

509
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:32,952
Regardless of where I lived,
my life would have been just like this.

510
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,351
<i>I'd be living the same mundane life,</i>

511
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:49,576
<i>and no one would ever be interested in me.</i>

512
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:55,160
<i>I felt like if I lived like this
for too long, I'd shrivel up and die.</i>

513
00:44:57,103 --> 00:44:58,924
<i>That's why I invented you.</i>

514
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,901
<i>You, who I'll meet someday.</i>

515
00:45:04,795 --> 00:45:06,491
<i>To you, at least…</i>

516
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:09,716
<i>I wouldn't be that ordinary, right?</i>

517
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:15,797
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

518
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:20,594
<i>I don't even know where you are.</i>

519
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,901
<i>And I've never met you.</i>

520
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:28,906
<i>Who…</i>

521
00:45:34,737 --> 00:45:36,515
<i>are you?</i>

522
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,414
This one's expired. Do you want it?

523
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:14,066
Do you want to eat Seoul?

524
00:46:14,645 --> 00:46:16,381
I don't really like Seoul.

525
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,866
I can't even be bothered
to ask you what you mean.

526
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:36,315
Headquarters said they'll
empty the place on the 18th.

527
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:37,969
Keep the doors locked until then.

528
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,318
I don't know how to lock them.

529
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,406
I've operated this place 24/7
for ten years.

530
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,183
So I've never done it.

531
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:50,748
How did you go to the bathroom?

532
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,560
A bike lock.

533
00:46:54,139 --> 00:46:56,992
I just wrapped one around
the handles and went.

534
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:02,947
Be sure to let me know
when you get married.

535
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,271
I'll give you

536
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,620
five hundred thousand won
to congratulate you.

537
00:47:10,888 --> 00:47:12,376
I'm serious, let me know.

538
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:14,279
I mean it!

539
00:47:14,858 --> 00:47:15,809
I will.

540
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:19,489
Just because I'm closing the store down,

541
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:22,012
it doesn't mean I'm closing the door
on our friendship.

542
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:27,429
What do you think?

543
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:29,911
Will you get married next year?

544
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:36,735
What is it?

545
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:49,182
What decides your fate?
She says it's your outlook on life.

546
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:50,630
Then what's my outlook?

547
00:47:51,126 --> 00:47:54,724
I can be positive
about things occasionally.

548
00:47:54,806 --> 00:47:56,130
Just one day, on my payday.

549
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:58,156
I'm not so bad that day.

550
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,837
You can afford to have a good outlook
if you have money.

551
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,897
The saying that love makes you kind
has some truth to it.

552
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:08,454
Whether it's money or a man,
if you have something,

553
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:10,894
you become positive, but…

554
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:13,664
do I have a man or any money?

555
00:48:13,748 --> 00:48:14,575
I have neither.

556
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:17,966
So how am I supposed to be positive
and have a good outlook on things?

557
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:23,258
I thought I'd feel better
if I had my hair done,

558
00:48:23,342 --> 00:48:24,954
but it just made me feel worse.

559
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,913
I can't drink anymore. I feel so terrible.

560
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:40,173
I feel even more terrible
because I don't like how I look today.

561
00:48:40,256 --> 00:48:41,992
I just want to go home and lie down.

562
00:50:13,273 --> 00:50:15,193
If you're more than five days late
on your credit loan payment,

563
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,840
your card gets suspended
and things become complicated.

564
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,603
This is why you shouldn't take out loans
to lend others money.

565
00:50:25,573 --> 00:50:27,558
Do you know how much your loan balance is?

566
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:36,863
For 15,484 million won,

567
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:39,262
you need to pay
about 1,5 million won per month.

568
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:06,142
<i>You'll be receiving a letter
at your home address soon.</i>

569
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,594
<i>The bank contacted me
because the loan payment is overdue.</i>

570
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:25,827
<i>Call and tell me what's happening.</i>

571
00:51:27,937 --> 00:51:30,336
UNREAD
1:06 P.M.

572
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:34,885
I'm home.

573
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,331
Hey, what about dinner?

574
00:51:36,415 --> 00:51:37,779
I ate.

575
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:40,343
Close the door properly,
or mosquitoes will come in.

576
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,728
What's the occasion?
You never come here on the weekend.

577
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:09,085
I guess you don't have
anything better to do.

578
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,454
Hey. What about us?

579
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,369
Gwang-min's driving me crazy.

580
00:52:44,154 --> 00:52:46,181
I'm seriously considering
quitting teaching.

581
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,206
How could a teacher badmouth his students?

582
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,572
You're an adult.

583
00:52:49,654 --> 00:52:51,805
You badmouth your colleagues
every day too.

584
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:52,880
They're my colleagues.

585
00:52:53,831 --> 00:52:56,396
My colleagues are kids, okay?

586
00:52:56,478 --> 00:52:59,539
Who's that woman?
The one you're always badmouthing.

587
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:03,839
The one who has "nasty, nasty, nasty,"
written all over her face.

588
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:06,321
Gwang-min is that woman to me, all right?

589
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:10,373
Do you know how hard it is to be stuck in
a classroom with Gwang-min all day long?

590
00:53:10,456 --> 00:53:11,573
Do you play favorites?

591
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,434
Yes, totally.

592
00:53:14,012 --> 00:53:15,915
What about you? Don't you play favorites?

593
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:17,982
I never play favorites. I hate everyone.

594
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:20,630
There isn't a single person I like.

595
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,152
You can't keep being like that.

596
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:26,254
I mean, that's why you struggle every day
and keep getting older.

597
00:53:27,867 --> 00:53:28,900
Jeez.

598
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,795
I guarantee you.

599
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:35,270
Gwang-min isn't the problem.
You're the problem.

600
00:53:35,931 --> 00:53:38,371
I also have a guarantee of my own.

601
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:42,631
Your colleague who has "nasty,
nasty, nasty," written all over her face

602
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,235
is probably normal too, you know?

603
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:46,725
She's only like that to you.

604
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:48,999
Let's stop,

605
00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:50,984
-or we'll develop feelings.
-For who?

606
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,759
Hey, give me another can.

607
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,447
Stop bringing it over.

608
00:54:13,068 --> 00:54:14,019
We've had enough.

609
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,497
Stop that. Is it that funny
that I broke up with her?

610
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,799
Just because I'm single, doesn't mean
I'm going to hang out with you.

611
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:53,100
To be honest, we only became friends
because we lived in the countryside.

612
00:54:53,182 --> 00:54:57,194
If we lived in the city,
I wouldn't have been friends with you.

613
00:54:57,897 --> 00:55:01,164
There were less than 15 people our age
within a 10km radius,

614
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:03,810
so I had no choice
but to hang out with you.

615
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:06,540
That's the problem with the countryside.
Everyone ends up being friends.

616
00:55:06,622 --> 00:55:09,848
When I tell people that the four of us
used to play together.

617
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,833
{\an8}They think we got along really well.

618
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:14,976
{\an8}But the truth is, there were
only four kids around here.

619
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:19,484
{\an8}She had no one her age and played
with the village idiot, didn't she?

620
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,394
{\an8}With Dumbo.

621
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:24,033
{\an8}Don't call him Dumbo. He's over forty now.

622
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:26,267
{\an8}Forty? Probably more like fifty.

623
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,601
{\an8}In the countryside,
friends and family are the same.

624
00:55:31,683 --> 00:55:35,034
{\an8}Do you get to choose your family?
You're born, and they're your family.

625
00:55:35,116 --> 00:55:37,722
{\an8}And they say
this kid living next door is your friend.

626
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:41,030
{\an8}Even at school,
if you don't like the kid next to you,

627
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:43,842
{\an8}you can just play with another kid.
But in this neighborhood?

628
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,951
{\an8}You don't get to choose.
It drives me nuts.

629
00:55:46,034 --> 00:55:50,707
{\an8}Hey, I feel the same. I never became
friends with you because I liked you too.

630
00:55:55,008 --> 00:55:56,993
{\an8}I should have been born in the Joseon era.

631
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,948
{\an8}"From this day forth,
this person is your spouse."

632
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:05,802
{\an8}Then I'd say, "Yes, I promise to love him
with all my heart."

633
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:07,249
{\an8}Even if I lived like that,

634
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:09,441
{\an8}I think I would have been just fine.

635
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:14,321
{\an8}This era where you have to choose
someone for yourself is way harder for me.

636
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:20,359
{\an8}I get rejected every day
but I prefer being in the present.

637
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:23,254
{\an8}If I were born in Joseon,
I'd definitely have been a peasant.

638
00:56:24,536 --> 00:56:26,148
{\an8}You're a peasant right now as well.

639
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,984
They say that
if the crickets are chirping,

640
00:56:37,066 --> 00:56:38,183
it's 24 degrees Celcius out.

641
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:41,036
Apparently, they know

642
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,434
that winter's on its way.

643
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:47,612
That's why they're working
so hard to find a mate

644
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:49,762
so they don't have to
spend the winter alone.

645
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,668
Even those tiny little creatures
find love, you know?

646
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:57,703
But as humans,

647
00:56:57,785 --> 00:56:59,812
shouldn't we be able to find love too?

648
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:03,534
Even they know what it's like
to have no partner in winter.

649
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,684
They're chirping away so desperately,

650
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:09,323
crying "winter's coming, it'll be cold,
don't leave me all alone."

651
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:11,225
We should do that too.

652
00:57:12,218 --> 00:57:13,046
Okay?

653
00:57:13,665 --> 00:57:15,278
What are you going on about?

654
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,496
Do humans have to do it
just because bugs and even cats do it?

655
00:57:20,117 --> 00:57:23,053
Do we have to poop
on the street like dogs do?

656
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:26,444
Don't then, you bastard!
I'll kill you if you do, okay?

657
00:57:28,471 --> 00:57:29,380
Hey, let's do it.

658
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,565
Let's do it, okay?

659
00:57:35,005 --> 00:57:37,899
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to love just anyone.

660
00:57:39,884 --> 00:57:41,001
Anyone? Really?

661
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:42,656
Yes, anyone.

662
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:44,475
Why can't I just love anyone?

663
00:57:44,557 --> 00:57:46,956
I was picky and ended up like this.

664
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,058
I was so careful not to pick a loser,
I have no one.

665
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,821
I'm allowed to just love anyone.
I'm going to love just anyone.

666
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:57,460
Starting tomorrow,

667
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,521
why don't you two just disappear?

668
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:02,796
They're nuts.

669
00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:12,679
-Thank you for the meal.
-Yes.

670
00:58:12,762 --> 00:58:14,292
You worked hard. Go rest.

671
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,739
Yes, get some rest.

672
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:17,394
Good night.

673
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,916
And don't drink too much!

674
00:58:31,372 --> 00:58:33,026
There's "anyone" over there.

675
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:35,838
Hey, run away!

676
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,616
Stay out of Yeom Gi-jeong's sight!

677
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,567
Get down!

678
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:43,282
-Get down!
-Have you lost it?

679
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:46,012
-Idiot.
-What are you doing? You're so loud.

680
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:47,170
You idiot.

681
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:49,734
Get down.

682
00:58:49,816 --> 00:58:51,553
Come on, stop it.

683
00:58:53,744 --> 00:58:54,696
You're nuts.

684
00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:55,937
Why would you do that?

685
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:49,699
I was wondering if you could
receive a piece of mail for me.

686
00:59:54,372 --> 00:59:56,936
I'm expecting something
I don't want my family to see.

687
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:36,755

MY LIBERATION NOTES

689
01:01:40,903 --> 01:01:43,176
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't have time to ask you.</i>

690
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:45,451
<i>What did he use to do?</i>

691
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:47,519
<i>Maybe he's in hiding here.</i>

692
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:50,745
-He bought alcohol again.
<i>-He says I should move there.</i>

693
01:01:50,828 --> 01:01:53,764
I'm a woman who has a lot of charm.

694
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:55,336
You've got to be kidding me.

695
01:01:55,418 --> 01:01:58,851
<i>Is he on bad terms with his girlfriend?
Who has he been talking to for so long?</i>

696
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:00,960
We're breaking up!
Just go out with her instead then!

697
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,449
<i>Something I had to figure out</i>

698
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:04,309
<i>but couldn't bring myself to.</i>

699
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:06,667
<i>-What did Mr. Gu say to you?
-It's nothing.</i>

700
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:08,900
<i>What? Yeom Mi-jeong doesn't live here.</i>

701
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:12,952
<i>Don't tell me you went out with him.</i>

702
01:02:13,035 --> 01:02:14,359
I don't think I can do it.

703
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,592
I want to feel whole for once.

704
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:18,783
I'll pick it up later.

705
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:20,479
<i>Why do you drink every day?</i>

706
01:02:21,182 --> 01:02:22,671
<i>Should I give you something
to do other than drink?</i>

707
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,909
