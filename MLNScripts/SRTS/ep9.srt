ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,

DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:15,837
STAR CLASS
MOON CLASS

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,656
SANPO SINKS

7
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:23,074
Careful.

8
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:36,844
Yes, please put them from here to here.

9
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:37,878
Sure, got it.

10
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:24,403
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

11
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,670
SOMETHING GOOD

12
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:32,219
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

13
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,739
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY.
IMMEDIATELY HE SPOKE TO THEM AND SAID,

14
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:53,558
TAKE COURAGE! IT IS I. DON’T BE AFRAID.
MARK 6:50

15
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,168
<i>It's just outside of Seoul.</i>

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,435
<i>I feel better when I see this.</i>

17
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,342
Here, drink this.

18
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:45,832
Doesn't my tan look bad?
As if I got it while working on a farm?

19
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,899
The one who works on a farm is pale.

20
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:51,414
I'm starting to peel.

21
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:55,012
You'd think coconut crabs would taste
sweet because they eat coconuts, right?

22
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,328
But they're not. Not at all.

23
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:01,505
SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURES

24
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,344
I'm very happy, thanks to you.

25
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:36,285
I'd had it and thought
I couldn't work with him anymore.

26
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:38,765
And, again,

27
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,454
there was no way
I'd find someone he'd like.

28
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,838
He's a different level of grumpy.

29
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:49,229
He doesn't even say
what he wants properly.

30
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,214
He just yells
if he doesn't like something.

31
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:01,387
How do you two just know what the other
needs without saying a word?

32
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:06,226
He just looks around, and you just
know what he wants and give it to him.

33
00:04:08,045 --> 00:04:10,775
I've lived with him for 40 years
and I still can't do that.

34
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,448
Maybe you were partners
in your past lives.

35
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,565
Such perfect teamwork.

36
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:24,877
I'm home.

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,862
Hey. You're back just in time.

38
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:29,550
-Sit. Eat before you wash up.
-Okay.

39
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:35,091
A new product came out. Try it.

40
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,499
It must be cooling down.

41
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,552
Even just a few days ago,
it was still so hot around this time.

42
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,728
I can tell the season is changing here.

43
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:19,755
But I can't tell in Seoul.

44
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,443
Hey, walk on this side.

45
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,887
There's something dead there.

46
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:31,913
What is it?

47
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:34,974
A bird?

48
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:39,110
I hope someone flips it over.

49
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:47,132
Why do animals die with their bellies up?

50
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,745
Like humans.

51
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,554
You see a dead animal every morning
in a neighborhood like this.

52
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,821
The head of a rat left behind by a weasel,

53
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,426
or a squirrel that drowned
in a water tank.

54
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:07,107
I used to see dead frogs most often
when I was little,

55
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,636
but we don't have paddies now.

56
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,896
Back when our house was
surrounded by paddies,

57
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,915
frogs used to cross the street
every night,

58
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:19,968
from this side to that side.

59
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,408
But if a car went by then…

60
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,254
you'd hear them burst.

61
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,638
In the dead of the night…

62
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:40,067
The next morning, you'd see

63
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,624
frog bits all over the ground
like confetti.

64
00:06:46,725 --> 00:06:49,909
But I don't know why they'd always
cross the street at night.

65
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,368
Was the ground too hot
for them during the day?

66
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,677
<i>I used to not talk unless someone made me.</i>

67
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,613
"Would anyone want to hear
what I have to say?"

68
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,474
But now,

69
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:18,486
I just say whatever's in my head.

70
00:07:19,354 --> 00:07:20,223
It just…

71
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,704
comes out.

72
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,095
And…

73
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:30,231
I have this feeling I've never had before.

74
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:35,359
Suddenly…

75
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,611
I feel lovable.

76
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:54,630
Who says something like that while eating?

77
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,233
Enjoy your lunch.

78
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,888
-Thanks.
-Well, then.

79
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:51,989
Is that why?

80
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:53,892
Yes.

81
00:08:55,795 --> 00:08:56,870
You're so brave.

82
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,287
I wanted to tell him how I felt,
but I was still scared to do it.

83
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:05,389
So I had a backup plan
in case I got rejected.

84
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,746
And this was the result.

85
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:10,434
You seem better than I expected, though.

86
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:15,562
My face still gets red
when I think about it.

87
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:19,904
But I can get over it
by humming to myself.

88
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,799
You're amazing.

89
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:26,108
I haven't seen such a spirit in a while.

90
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:30,284
To be honest, I feel okay

91
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,221
because of his attitude, you know?

92
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:37,481
You know, you told me I'm the type
who cares about a guy's attitude.

93
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,300
So the reason it turned out that way--

94
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,699
Thanks for the food.

95
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,014
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

96
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:45,421
Coffee's on me.

97
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,714
I turned my phone off that day
because I was so embarrassed.

98
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:52,699
Why? In case he called you?

99
00:09:52,782 --> 00:09:55,263
{\an8}No. In case he didn't.

100
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,985
{\an8}I thought it would be better not to know

101
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:02,418
{\an8}whether he called me or not
than to know that he didn't.

102
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:03,864
{\an8}But then…

103
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,173
{\an8}"Right, I'm injured!"

104
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,647
{\an8}<i>"It's only right
that he should ask if I'm okay."</i>

105
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,177
{\an8}<i>"I'm even his sister's friend."</i>

106
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,452
{\an8}<i>"Of course,
he should ask if I'm all right."</i>

107
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,024
{\an8}<i>So, I turned it back on.</i>

108
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,415
{\an8}<i>Are you okay?</i>

109
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:24,088
{\an8}<i>Have you seen a doctor?</i>

110
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,080
{\an8}CHO TAE-HUN

111
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:28,223
{\an8}<i>You must have turned your phone off.</i>

112
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:33,144
{\an8}<i>Please send me a message. I'm worried.</i>

113
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,134
{\an8}<i>Even when I was talking
to people at church today,</i>

114
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:42,822
{\an8}<i>my heart was heavy all day long.</i>

115
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,874
{\an8}Did you order my <i>jjamppong</i>?

116
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,156
{\an8}I did.

117
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:51,961
{\an8}<i>I've looked back on it.</i>

118
00:10:52,664 --> 00:10:54,401
{\an8}<i>I realized</i>

119
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,799
{\an8}<i>I always had fun when you were around.</i>

120
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,811
{\an8}<i>You were always smiling.</i>

121
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:05,360
{\an8}<i>I felt very supported when you asked me
for the list of friends</i>

122
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,221
{\an8}<i>who put me in that fight.</i>

123
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,620
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

124
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,514
{\an8}<i>It's fair to believe that I led you on.</i>

125
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:14,003
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry.</i>

126
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:18,139
{\an8}<i>I hope our relationship doesn't end here.</i>

127
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,308
<i>I'd like to treat you to a meal,
as I promised.</i>

128
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,409
<i>Whenever, wherever.</i>

129
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,394
<i>As soon as you can,</i>

130
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:30,256
<i>I'll be waiting to hear from you.</i>

131
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,267
CHO TAE-HUN

132
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,989
He's sincere.

133
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,809
Yes, exactly.

134
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,373
Honestly, I was terrified.

135
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,061
I was terrified that he'd think,
"This girl's nuts."

136
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,376
"How dare she ask me out," and ignore me.

137
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:51,885
But he…
The way he put how he felt into words…

138
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,689
It's my first time feeling this grateful
after getting rejected.

139
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,467
I read it over and over.

140
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,238
-I've even memorized it.
-He said he went to church, right?

141
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,050
Yes, church.

142
00:12:08,385 --> 00:12:12,025
To tell you the truth,
I did a lot of self-reflection.

143
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,085
To all the guys who asked me out
that I got so angry at…

144
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,807
There have been guys.
Please don't think there weren't any.

145
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,453
There's your world, and there's my world.

146
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:24,513
But in both worlds,
men and women are exactly the same.

147
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:27,077
Asking out, getting rejected,
crying, and laughing…

148
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:29,849
Well, anyway,

149
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:33,074
I repented my arrogance

150
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:35,638
and decided to take a leap of faith…

151
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:39,029
and I think I did well.

152
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:42,048
Even if you get rejected,
you can learn something

153
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:43,454
if it's by a gentleman.

154
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,067
I think

155
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:50,360
I saw how dignified a person can be.

156
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,729
But that doesn't mean

157
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,996
I'm holding out hope or anything.

158
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm not, really.

159
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:05,166
It's just,

160
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,887
I learned something
about dealing with people,

161
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:12,693
so I think I'll be able
to love someone this winter.

162
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,158
I think you will.

163
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:21,790
Really.

164
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:28,160
GOURMET PORK CUTLET
DOUBLE CRISPY

165
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,095
From Friday onwards, A-reum's dad owns
Branch 2 in Baehyeon.

166
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:34,321
Will he be better or worse
than his daughter?

167
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,001
Don't bother hoping.
Have you still not given up?

168
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,798
If you think about it, it's simple.

169
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:45,900
It's her dad's store.
She'll visit often to make more money.

170
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:48,216
"Let's sell this and that. Don't do that."

171
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,739
She'll be doing everything.
Just forget it.

172
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:53,716
You just need to focus
on your own performance.

173
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,149
I thought I would be grateful
if only A-reum would disappear,

174
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:00,126
but I even have to
deal with her father now.

175
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,014
I had a dream a few nights ago.

176
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:06,578
I had leeches on the back of my hand,

177
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:09,762
and more appeared
until my whole hand was covered in them.

178
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:11,334
So I said,

179
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:15,180
"I have no blood, I'm a block of wood,"

180
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,537
and all of them just fell off,
totally powerless.

181
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,308
What a weird dream.

182
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:23,451
Don't you guys dream?

183
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,477
I have at least three dreams a night.

184
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,049
-Hey.
-What?

185
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,075
So this is where you guys were.

186
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:31,929
Have you been waiting long?

187
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:33,624
Not at all.

188
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:36,684
Table for two?

189
00:14:39,456 --> 00:14:40,324
Can we go first?

190
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:43,550
Sure, go ahead.

191
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,866
All right. Thank you.

192
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,081
"I am

193
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,396
a block of wood."

194
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,460
-You guys wait here.
-Sure.

195
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,709
Seriously.

196
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,066
Why are the tables at that restaurant
all so small?

197
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:22,258
Once you put your phone and wallet on it,

198
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,077
there's no space left to put your cup.

199
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,386
And you have to eat
so carefully, like this.

200
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,206
Why do we have to eat like that?

201
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,631
What did you have, Chang-hee?

202
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,544
I asked what you ate.

203
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:40,537
Kimchi stew.

204
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,349
-At Mr. Park's place?
-Yes.

205
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:47,237
You should have told me if you were
going to eat kimchi stew there!

206
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,717
I'd have gone there, too.

207
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:53,357
It seems the queue there
wasn't too long today.

208
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,928
Seeing as you came back early.

209
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,932
What will you have tomorrow?

210
00:16:00,016 --> 00:16:02,372
I don't know
what I'll want to eat tomorrow.

211
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,681
How about you eat the kimchi stew
there again tomorrow?

212
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,290
-Do you like me?
-What?

213
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,392
Why do you follow me around?

214
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:18,294
What?

215
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,279
When did I follow you around?

216
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,057
Are you a narcissist?

217
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:24,001
That's ridiculous.

218
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,532
It's ridiculous for me too.

219
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,370
I'm not even your boyfriend.
Why do I have to queue for you?

220
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:33,761
When did I ask you to queue for me?

221
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,739
I was just asking. I can't even do that?

222
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,716
Asking me if I could have
kimchi stew again tomorrow

223
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,611
sounds like you're asking me
if I could queue for you.

224
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:46,333
For office workers, a nice lunch
is the only thing we can enjoy.

225
00:16:46,415 --> 00:16:48,318
Why do I have to
give that up just for you?

226
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,724
Are we that close?

227
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,051
Why don't you queue for me tomorrow, then?

228
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,236
I think I'll want to have
Pyongyang <i>naengmyeon</i> tomorrow.

229
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,676
Will you queue
at Yaksan Naengmyeon for me?

230
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:04,984
Why do you ask people

231
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,672
for something
you're not willing to do for them?

232
00:17:18,218 --> 00:17:19,665
What's your problem?

233
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,113
I mean,

234
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:25,331
if you want to eat kimchi stew,
is asking that we go together

235
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,109
something to get this angry about?

236
00:17:27,977 --> 00:17:31,120
I said, I don't know
what I'll want to have tomorrow.

237
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,874
Hey, stop! Pull over.

238
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,396
Damn it.

239
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,266
Damn it.

240
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:41,218
What's wrong?

241
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:43,203
It seems there was an accident.

242
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:37,998
It's really you.

243
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:46,062
What are you doing here?

244
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:17,001
Golf went strangely well for me today.

245
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:20,392
So I thought, "This must be my lucky day."

246
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,329
And it turns out it is!

247
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:28,291
You, Gu Ja-gyeong, hid so well
that no one knew if you were alive,

248
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,483
yet I bumped into you on the road.

249
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,175
What are you doing here? Are you putting
on a show? Acting like you're broken?

250
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,194
A show?

251
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,796
Why do I have to act like I'm broken?

252
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,563
Hey, what kind of guy calls someone
and asks if they're driving

253
00:20:58,645 --> 00:20:59,969
when his girlfriend died?

254
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,293
Asking to stop the car.

255
00:21:01,788 --> 00:21:03,030
Who does that?

256
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:06,172
I thought you were talking about my wife.

257
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,488
But it was your girl.

258
00:21:18,082 --> 00:21:20,854
You must have been acting.

259
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,037
You wanted her dead, didn't you?

260
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:55,054
<i>I heard you cried so hard
when your dog died.</i>

261
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:58,611
<i>That you went around
with your eyes all red.</i>

262
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:03,449
But a person died. Your girl, at that.

263
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,333
How did you not cry at all?

264
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:16,021
How could a human be like that?

265
00:22:19,123 --> 00:22:21,521
You have no idea
how frustrating she could be, do you?

266
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:24,871
Of course not. She's your little sister.

267
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:54,316
What a relief, right?

268
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:57,542
It would've been bad
if you guys got into a big accident.

269
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:05,771
Change the rope tomorrow.

270
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,494
What would you have done
if you weren't with Mr. Gu?

271
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:22,444
Sometimes…

272
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,925
he buys this one.

273
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,779
How old is he?

274
00:24:41,302 --> 00:24:42,749
Where's he from?

275
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:56,851
She wouldn't stop asking,
so I just made things up.

276
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:58,712
"He's 38."

277
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,615
"He's from Seoul."

278
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:03,634
In case she asked your name,

279
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:08,720
"Gu Ja-cheol, Gu Ja-seung, Gu Ja-gyeong."

280
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:12,442
I tried to come up
with names that start with "Ja,"

281
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:13,931
but she didn't ask in the end.

282
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:20,920
Did I get "Ja" right?

283
00:25:22,078 --> 00:25:25,180
It must be either "Bon" or "Ja," right?

284
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,075
Are you tired?

285
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,947
I walked 10km.

286
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,124
Why?

287
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,497
I didn't have my wallet on me.

288
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:09,843
Rest up, then.

289
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,472
I'm home.

290
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,540
Okay. Have you had dinner?

291
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:35,070
I ate.

292
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:36,682
Why are you coming from Gu's house?

293
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:45,491
Did he ask you to buy some liquor for him?

294
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:51,653
We just talked.

295
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:53,473
About what?

296
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,349
Why can't you tell me?

297
00:27:09,146 --> 00:27:10,263
We're dating.

298
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,805
Oh, my God.

299
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:42,148
ALCOHOL STATION
GWANGHWAMUN 1ST ST.

300
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,557
There are so many things
about her that bother me.

301
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:51,700
Why did I have to blow up over food?
That's so lame.

302
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:55,960
Why is 80% of what you say
when we drink about Jeong A-reum?

303
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,276
It's not like you love her.

304
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,964
I want to stop talking about her, too.

305
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,570
But I have to stop seeing her to do that.

306
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,085
Don't worry.

307
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,112
You won't once you become a manager.

308
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,551
It's only a few days away.

309
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,404
You never know if I will.

310
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,919
At least one of you should get promoted.

311
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,310
Either you or A-reum.

312
00:28:23,007 --> 00:28:25,405
On the day I don't have
to see her anymore,

313
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:26,563
don't stop me.

314
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,210
Don't stop me. I'll give my all.

315
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:34,752
I'll go at her so hard
that she'll have to change.

316
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:37,067
I'll join your battle.

317
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,762
I will build you a monument

318
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:40,624
in front of Dangmi Station.

319
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,842
Well, you can lash out at her
if you want to.

320
00:28:46,455 --> 00:28:48,688
But, hey, Chang-hee.

321
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:49,763
You…

322
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:56,132
You need to think about why you hate
Jeong A-reum so much, at least once.

323
00:28:57,372 --> 00:29:00,268
What, do I have to think to know that?
Don't you hate A-reum?

324
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,956
You don't just hate her.

325
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,671
You hate her so much.

326
00:29:07,753 --> 00:29:10,359
She makes me hate her so much.

327
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,012
For us, it's just…

328
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,230
"God, she's crazy. What a bitch."
Nothing more, nothing less.

329
00:29:16,314 --> 00:29:18,877
Try being seated next to that crazy lady

330
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,103
and listen to her yammer on all day.

331
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:26,114
A woman who has no humanity at all
but is just full of greed,

332
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:29,423
talking all day about stuff
that's not even interesting. You try it!

333
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:35,833
If Jeong A-reum wasn't rich…

334
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:39,885
would you have hated her that much?

335
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,972
If she was a normal woman
from a normal family,

336
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,578
would you still have hated her that much?

337
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,548
Just be honest.

338
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,525
{\an8}Am I being insincere?

339
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:57,007
{\an8}Hey, tell me. Am I the bad guy?
Am I the bad guy here?

340
00:29:57,627 --> 00:30:00,522
{\an8}Rich or not, she deserves to be hated!

341
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:01,886
{\an8}I mean, what I'm saying is…

342
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:03,913
{\an8}That's enough.

343
00:30:03,995 --> 00:30:05,237
{\an8}What I'm saying is,

344
00:30:05,815 --> 00:30:08,669
{\an8}you might be just as greedy as A-reum

345
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:11,357
{\an8}but just pretending that you aren't.

346
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,294
{\an8}You know? In this world,
there are greedy people everywhere.

347
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:17,395
{\an8}Why do you hate Jeong A-reum so much?

348
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:20,868
{\an8}Should I hate someone I don't know, then?
She's the one I know.

349
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,474
{\an8}I mean, what I'm saying is,

350
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:26,286
{\an8}don't deny your greed,

351
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:29,057
{\an8}and just take what you want.

352
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,869
{\an8}If you become rich?

353
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,591
{\an8}You won't hate Jeong A-reum anymore.

354
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,264
{\an8}If I get rich?

355
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,302
{\an8}Why would I hate anyone?

356
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:48,577
{\an8}When I have enough, why would I?

357
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:51,802
Why are you saying something so obvious?

358
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:56,682
If I get rich…

359
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,396
Well, I'll probably
hate her just a little.

360
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,510
I mean…

361
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:21,206
Did I say something wrong?

362
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,499
I need to tell him the truth, don't I?

363
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:27,822
We're friends.

364
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,737
Let's go!

365
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:12,073
I'm not even some hero
trying to save his country.

366
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:15,174
Why do I feel so ashamed?

367
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:23,362
SANPO KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSETS

368
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,278
Aren't you going to change the rope?

369
00:33:20,143 --> 00:33:21,218
Oh, dear.

370
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:40,118
I might be living like this,

371
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:44,212
but there are plenty of people
in the sink business

372
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,569
who drive expensive cars and play golf.

373
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:52,028
I just made a mistake
standing surety for someone.

374
00:33:53,806 --> 00:33:57,114
But thanks to this business,
I managed to pay off that debt

375
00:33:57,198 --> 00:34:01,332
and hold onto my land and house.

376
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:13,615
If you do this work steadily,
you'll have a good life.

377
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,402
I'll go buy a new rope.

378
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,355
Everything…

379
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,897
looks bizarre when it's on the ground.

380
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:21,686
It's just a nail,

381
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,291
but why does it look
like a woman's dead body?

382
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,641
That's creepy.

383
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,453
Whose is it?

384
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:31,694
I don't know.

385
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:43,811
I went to the mall for a change,
but it only ruined my mood.

386
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:47,450
Are they that great?
Why are they laughing so loud?

387
00:35:47,987 --> 00:35:49,725
I felt so small all by myself.

388
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,751
Go with me next time.

389
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:55,390
I just went to buy
a stick of lipstick, damn it.

390
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,538
Why do I

391
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:20,699
hate other women my age who shop
in groups at the mall so much?

392
00:36:21,817 --> 00:36:23,512
Because they're there to spend money.

393
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,490
They must have husbands. And kids too.

394
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:28,929
In front of those women,

395
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:33,188
I want to make them feel small by buying
something too expensive for them.

396
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:38,193
I want to have a body that the sexiest,
coolest clothes would look good on.

397
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:42,907
I hate seeing a family of four even more
than those women who shop in groups.

398
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,769
Those perfect fortresses.

399
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,400
We also came from families, you know?

400
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:51,467
Hey, we never go anywhere as a family.

401
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:54,570
Why would we? Seeing each other at home
is already more than enough.

402
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:01,765
The family we'll have one day…

403
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:06,604
Will it be the same
as the family we came from?

404
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:13,428
It's all the same.

405
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:18,597
But you still want to do it.
Humans are so dumb.

406
00:37:22,029 --> 00:37:23,849
-Hello.
-Hello.

407
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,041
There you go. Time to go home.

408
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:27,860
-Bye.
-Bye.

409
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:28,853
-Yu-rim!
-Let's go.

410
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,507
-Did you study hard?
-Yes.

411
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,286
-Goodbye.
-All right, goodbye.

412
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:34,353
-Should I carry your bag?
-It's okay.

413
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:36,710
Let's go home.
Auntie made deep-fried squid.

414
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,741
Your auntie

415
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:47,793
borrowed all the books you need
from the library.

416
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:51,887
Studying is hard, right?

417
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:58,877
Why do you always say "auntie did this,"
"auntie did that" when you talk to me?

418
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:05,948
Just in case

419
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:08,802
people think I'm your mom,

420
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:11,779
and that makes you upset.

421
00:38:16,205 --> 00:38:19,348
Your mom's so much prettier than me,
you know?

422
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:40,728
Is it good?

423
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,518
I envy you. You have aunties,

424
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,627
who cook delicious meals for you.

425
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,157
My auntie was…

426
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,142
Go and sleep if you're drunk.

427
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,158
Aunties are all you've got.

428
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:04,714
Your aunties have decided
to give up on being women.

429
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,064
But your dad…

430
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,289
he's still a man.

431
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,617
I know everything, you punk.

432
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,234
Did that girl ask you for a Chanel?

433
00:39:24,316 --> 00:39:26,219
You've never bought us lipstick.

434
00:39:29,693 --> 00:39:31,471
I already saw that thing in your trunk.

435
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,666
Do you think something in a Chanel bag
has to be from Chanel?

436
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:40,527
It's a toolbox.

437
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,938
Cho Gyeong-seon,
go to your room and sleep,

438
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,460
He's definitely seeing someone.

439
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,231
Lately, he's been looking
at his phone all day.

440
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:53,844
He changes the pattern lock now.

441
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,202
Hey, you never used the pattern lock
before, right?

442
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,336
See? I'm right.

443
00:40:00,419 --> 00:40:02,239
That punk's seeing someone.

444
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:04,927
Hey! Show me your phone, you bastard!

445
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,540
Gosh!

446
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,187
I told you not to swear at him.
He's a father.

447
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:17,127
What about me?

448
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,619
I'm an auntie.
And I'll be forty very soon!

449
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:32,676
YEOM GI-JEONG

450
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,455
THANK YOU. YOU'RE VERY CONSIDERATE.

451
00:40:38,962 --> 00:40:40,286
ARE YOU OKAY?

452
00:40:40,368 --> 00:40:42,353
DELETE

453
00:40:43,346 --> 00:40:46,779
I'M FINE. THERE'S NO NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

454
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:51,286
I'M TOUCHED.
LET'S DRINK AGAIN SOMETIME.

455
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:56,580
DELETE FOR ME
THE MESSAGE WILL ONLY BE DELETED

456
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,986
FROM YOUR CHATROOM AND WILL STILL BE
VISIBLE TO YOUR FRIEND(S)

457
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,535
DELETE

458
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:28,217
I've seen a fake nail
on the window sill of a bus once,

459
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,581
and it felt so weird.

460
00:41:30,242 --> 00:41:33,014
It's bizarre when you see a thing
somewhere it doesn't belong.

461
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:38,596
A bird lying on the ground,

462
00:41:39,424 --> 00:41:40,871
a man hanging in a tree…

463
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:46,040
even a dog on a farm.

464
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:54,725
How come you didn't drink today?

465
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,966
3 MISSED CALLS

466
00:42:07,049 --> 00:42:09,737
WHY AREN'T YOU ANSWERING AGAIN?
I HEARD YOU MET BAEK. WHAT HAPPENED?

467
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,283
Why won't you answer it?

468
00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:33,764
I don't have to.

469
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:37,899
Are you tired today, too?

470
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,550
What is it?

471
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:48,776
You told them we were dating.

472
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:53,201
Yes.

473
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:56,551
Why did you do that?

474
00:42:57,254 --> 00:42:59,032
You don't even know when I'll leave.

475
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,096
This could've passed
without anyone knowing.

476
00:43:11,397 --> 00:43:13,714
It's not a big deal
for people to date and break up.

477
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:15,078
Why keep it a secret?

478
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,718
I'll leave after eating some.

479
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,812
So say what you want to say
if you have anything.

480
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:43,819
A long time ago…

481
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:52,587
I this saw on TV.

482
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:58,831
There's this famous cliff in the US
where people commit suicide.

483
00:44:00,279 --> 00:44:04,083
And they interviewed people
who survived after jumping off that cliff.

484
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:06,979
They all said…

485
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:11,569
when you reach two-thirds of the way
down the cliff,

486
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,877
whatever made you want to kill yourself,

487
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:17,896
didn't feel like anything anymore.

488
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,122
Just a few seconds ago,

489
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:25,753
they thought dying was
the only way out and jumped.

490
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,731
But in just a few seconds,

491
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:30,716
that feeling

492
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:34,438
started to feel like nothing.

493
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,965
I thought it would be the same for her.

494
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,604
So I told her.

495
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:52,800
"To a person who feels like
living is so painful,

496
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,481
getting therapy

497
00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:00,285
is reaching two-thirds
of your way down a cliff

498
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:07,357
without ending up killing yourself."

499
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:09,921
And…

500
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:16,827
that she should see a therapist.

501
00:45:18,647 --> 00:45:19,598
I told her that.

502
00:45:20,757 --> 00:45:21,624
But…

503
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:24,933
she just jumped and died.

504
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:40,441
Who did?

505
00:45:43,212 --> 00:45:44,288
The woman…

506
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:47,100
The woman I used to live with.

507
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,231
<i>You told her that
because you wanted her dead, didn't you?</i>

508
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,671
She was already vulnerable.

509
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:02,194
And you encouraged her, didn't you?

510
00:46:06,453 --> 00:46:09,017
Yes. I was telling her to die.

511
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:17,744
It was so…

512
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:24,443
frustrating to see her suffer so much.

513
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:37,553
I'll stop if you tell me to.

514
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:40,861
The worshiping…

515
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,451
You can take it back.

516
00:47:00,298 --> 00:47:01,828
When did you ever worship me?

517
00:47:53,274 --> 00:47:57,534
You bastard. It's you that killed her,
but I can't sue you for it.

518
00:47:58,071 --> 00:48:00,759
Saying you told someone
to die won't fly in court.

519
00:48:00,842 --> 00:48:01,793
What do I do then?

520
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:04,895
I've got to kill you myself.

521
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,075
Come on. I didn't hide that hard.

522
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,019
Okay?

523
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:19,493
I waited with my door open,
but you never came.

524
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:24,290
You were so quiet
after taking all of my business.

525
00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:29,005
You don't care about that at all.

526
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,901
Did you two have sweet dreams?

527
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:38,450
They should just announce it
at nine in the morning.

528
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:41,096
But at 5 p.m.?
Are they teasing us on purpose?

529
00:49:41,675 --> 00:49:44,446
But if they did it in the morning,
it'd affect your work.

530
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:46,224
Are you saying I won't get it?

531
00:49:46,307 --> 00:49:48,581
Whether you get it or not,
it will affect you.

532
00:49:52,551 --> 00:49:55,695
Whatever the result is,
let's have a drink together tonight.

533
00:49:58,217 --> 00:49:59,333
Yes, sir.

534
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:10,127
<i>Do you have time this evening?</i>

535
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,533
<i>How about dinner together?</i>

536
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,757
You said you were going to bed,
but you spent the night with that bastard?

537
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,271
I went to bed. Then I got a call
from him and went out to see him.

538
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:36,471
I already told you!

539
00:50:36,554 --> 00:50:39,862
I'm asking why you had to go see
your ex-boyfriend for God's sake!

540
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:42,343
He said he was really sick.
How could I have not?

541
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:45,941
Why would you go just because
an ex tells you he's sick?

542
00:50:46,024 --> 00:50:47,967
Yes, I would. Even if they're my ex.

543
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,449
Even if we broke up,
I'd go see you if you were sick.

544
00:50:50,531 --> 00:50:54,295
Even if it was an ex I broke up
with ten years ago, I would go!

545
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:57,189
So?

546
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:00,167
You just nursed him all night?

547
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,070
You did nothing else all night? Fuck!

548
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:04,882
What else would I have done
with someone so sick?

549
00:51:05,874 --> 00:51:09,265
Why are you breaking my stuff?
Go break your stuff, you bastard!

550
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:15,386
Damn you. I'll do it, too. Damn it.

551
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:17,660
You crazy bastard.

552
00:51:45,203 --> 00:51:46,568
I was definitely fine.

553
00:51:48,057 --> 00:51:50,000
Why do I feel different than yesterday?

554
00:51:51,944 --> 00:51:53,060
You've had a drink.

555
00:51:54,053 --> 00:51:55,666
I keep thinking about what he said.

556
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:59,718
That it felt like he lost
both of his arms when he lost his parents.

557
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:04,722
I feel bad since I feel like
I've abandoned a guy who wants to escape

558
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,328
from feeling weak.

559
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:12,663
I mean, I'm the one who got rejected.

560
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,309
But why does it feel like I abandoned him?

561
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:16,840
It's driving me crazy.

562
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:18,494
Hey, what is this?

563
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:21,885
I'm the one who got abandoned.
I'm the one who got rejected!

564
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:31,769
His place is just 500m from here.

565
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:40,040
Let's go.

566
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:41,653
Where?

567
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:43,225
-Home.
-Okay.

568
00:52:49,014 --> 00:52:50,131
Slow down.

569
00:52:52,322 --> 00:52:54,017
You don't need to use the bathroom?

570
00:52:57,533 --> 00:53:00,138
<i>"Let's run away."</i>

571
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,165
<i>Telling myself that,</i>

572
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,308
<i>I got on the train in a hurry.</i>

573
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:11,553
<i>Why do I feel sorry for you
when I should feel sorry for myself?</i>

574
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:15,109
<i>Tae-hun, be bold.</i>

575
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,963
<i>Be bold so I won't have to worry
about you.</i>

576
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:20,733
<i>Yeom Gi-jeong.
You're the one who got rejected.</i>

577
00:53:20,816 --> 00:53:23,545
<i>Why are you feeling bad for him right now?</i>

578
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,130
MY LIBERATION NOTES
YEOM MI-JEONG

579
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,660
Was it a power cut?

580
00:55:48,371 --> 00:55:50,356
I love this feeling.

581
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:54,574
Feeling spent
after I've emptied my bowels.

582
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:59,331
Feeling relieved that I made it
without soiling my underwear.

583
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:03,879
I downed two iced lattes

584
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:06,981
because I wanted
to have diarrhea so badly.

585
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,380
It didn't seem to work all day.

586
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,812
But I suddenly started to feel it
on my way back home.

587
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:17,650
I thought "I can hold it.
I can hold it until I get home."

588
00:56:17,734 --> 00:56:22,199
And when I was almost there,
I saw my dad going into the bathroom,

589
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:27,907
I was like, "I can make it.
I can make it to Gu's place."

590
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:31,463
And lucky me. You even have a bidet!

591
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,433
My butt felt so good,
I felt like I was going to fly.

592
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:39,693
I use that old toilet you crouch over.

593
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,745
We have three people going to work
in the morning, but only one toilet.

594
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,693
My dream is to be like you.

595
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,415
Living alone, with a bidet.

596
00:56:59,543 --> 00:57:01,197
Why do you look angry?

597
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:06,078
Right.

598
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:08,682
You must have been startled.

599
00:57:10,503 --> 00:57:11,660
I'm sorry.

600
00:57:20,676 --> 00:57:21,916
Neither of us

601
00:57:23,116 --> 00:57:24,273
got promoted.

602
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:30,270
Not me or the woman I really hate.

603
00:57:32,173 --> 00:57:33,868
And since we didn't get promoted,

604
00:57:34,943 --> 00:57:36,846
we have to see each other
for another year.

605
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:42,056
They say like attracts like.

606
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:47,267
Why can't I get away from where I am?

607
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,016
I felt like I was stuck somewhere,

608
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:56,779
but after giving it my all,

609
00:57:57,482 --> 00:57:59,880
I feel much better.

610
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:05,298
Though I failed to get promoted,

611
00:58:05,959 --> 00:58:11,005
I survived another day
without soiling my underwear.

612
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:16,836
Bit…

613
00:58:18,035 --> 00:58:19,896
talking to you in a low volume like this,

614
00:58:20,765 --> 00:58:24,032
makes me feel as if we're very close.

615
00:58:29,077 --> 00:58:31,062
They say like attracts like.

616
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:36,356
What do you think
we're meant to do together?

617
00:58:39,457 --> 00:58:40,615
<i>I said, get off!</i>

618
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,481
The last train has left!

619
00:59:30,283 --> 00:59:32,061
SAM-SIK:
I'M AT OIDO STATION, EXIT 1

620
00:59:32,144 --> 00:59:34,749
SAM-SIK:
WHERE ARE YOU?

621
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:37,603
VILLAGE BUS STOP
SANPO

622
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:45,916
Hello?

623
00:59:47,528 --> 00:59:49,265
He's not getting up!

624
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:51,705
Yes, can you come to the station?

625
00:59:57,371 --> 00:59:59,025
AVAILABLE

626
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,326
Get up!

627
01:00:13,457 --> 01:00:17,882
OIDO STATION

628
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,665
TAXI
AVAILABLE

629
01:00:24,748 --> 01:00:26,774
I think he got wind of it.
He's not here, sir.

630
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,387
What?

631
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,575
God damn it.

632
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:44,060
What are you waiting for? Keep looking!

633
01:00:44,143 --> 01:00:45,260
-Yes, sir!
-Yes.

634
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:51,918
<i>Who tipped you off?</i>

635
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:55,930
<i>I mean, you got off
the train midway that day.</i>

636
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,080
Who told you?

637
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:28,269
I didn't!

638
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:31,164
I know you ate it.
I heard rustling last night.

639
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:32,653
You always play dumb.

640
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,927
Go buy another one.

MY LIBERATION NOTES

643
01:03:28,819 --> 01:03:32,293
There are a lot of crazy jerks
who do bad things and blame you for it.

644
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,989
I don't owe you anything, do I?

645
01:03:34,071 --> 01:03:37,173
<i>It's just what you say when you want
to end it with a woman, isn't it?</i>

646
01:03:37,256 --> 01:03:39,447
<i>I could picture his past at once.</i>

647
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,143
<i>A man who fell from the very top…</i>

648
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,741
Chang-hee seems okay these days.

649
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:47,015
<i>-Is he dating someone?
-It can't be a girl.</i>

650
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:49,166
-I've just been invited over.
<i>-He did?</i>

651
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:53,384
-Bottoms up?
<i>-Do you have feelings for Gi-jeong?</i>

652
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,700
Hey! Get lost!

653
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:57,685
-Go!
<i>-You keep making things worse.</i>

654
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,697
<i>If you have something to say, say it.</i>

655
01:04:01,779 --> 01:04:03,682
<i>I still think you're okay.</i>

656
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,660
<i>Let's keep going.</i>
