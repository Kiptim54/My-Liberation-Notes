MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,426
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:13,193
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:41,316
Here. Help yourself
as much as you want, okay?

6
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,110
Go on.

7
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,490
I'm done.

8
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,086
I've never heard that man

9
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,590
compliment anyone on the job.
Not even once.

10
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,466
But he loves you.

11
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,095
He says you're a good worker
and that you'd be good at anything.

12
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:14,600
I've never heard him compliment
anyone other than Mi-jeong.

13
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,520
She's always been his favorite, you know.

14
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,857
He always glares at me
when he sees the drawers I make,

15
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,359
but he never complains about her work.

16
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:29,865
She could install moldings and use every
machine since she was in third grade.

17
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,284
And she was quite good.

18
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,625
Look. That's her at the workshop
when she was little.

19
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:48,800
Her siblings would always
toss their book bags

20
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:50,552
and run outside after school,

21
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,347
but she'd go to the workshop
even before doing her homework.

22
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,224
I guess she found it fun.

23
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,435
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have been so into it.

24
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,520
Hey, I need a basket!

25
00:02:00,604 --> 00:02:01,563
Okay!

26
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,564
Seriously.

27
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,358
Zip it until we get home.

28
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,777
I'm your only older sister. How could you?

29
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,488
Jeez, that's enough!

30
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,241
-What are you talking about?
-Here we go again!

31
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,537
That asshole said "fuck" to my face
in front of everybody!

32
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,415
I never said anything like "fuck"!

33
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:02,541
I heard it!

34
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:05,043
Okay, fine, I said it. I said "fuck."

35
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:07,170
Who brings their coffee
onto a bus these days?

36
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:11,633
There was only ice in the cup.
I just couldn't find a trash can, dumbass.

37
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:15,011
Why do you wear high heels when you
can't even balance yourself properly?

38
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,848
Why did you have to
carry it and fall into my arms?

39
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,766
I didn't fall into your arms.

40
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,892
When did I?

41
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:22,602
-I was just like this.
-Damn it!

42
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:23,645
-I didn't.
-Jeez!

43
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,897
This is embarrassing.
Cut it out and get inside.

44
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:27,983
For God's sake.

45
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,067
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

46
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,654
That little bastard.
How dare he glare at me like that?

47
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,826
Yeom Chang-hee.

48
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:39,619
Yeom Chang-hee.

49
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,804
Jeez, look what you did to her.

50
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,752
Hey, that's…

51
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:33,131
That's my slipper.

52
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,807
Seriously, why would you throw that?

53
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,850
Jeez.

54
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,519
You go get it.

55
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:53,527
All the other kids
get along with their siblings just fine.

56
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:56,613
So what's wrong
with the kids in this house?

57
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,699
All you ever do is yell at each other,
you know that?

58
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,036
Aren't you old enough to know
how embarrassing it is?

59
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,955
I held back until I got home.

60
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,717
You've got to be careful with Mi-jeong.

61
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,177
She has a temper.

62
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:21,304
It's scary when she loses it.

63
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,348
I mean, she's…

64
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:24,641
How should I put this?

65
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,394
The thing about kids who can't fight is

66
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:30,021
that they don't know when to stop.

67
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,232
Gi-jeong and I fight all the time,

68
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,110
but we still make sure
not to cross the line.

69
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,362
But with Mi-jeong, if she gets angry,

70
00:05:37,445 --> 00:05:40,532
she'd just kick you right off of a cliff,
if you know what I mean.

71
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,952
She just doesn't think.
She doesn't care about the consequences.

72
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,968
Jeez, this is utterly exhausting.

73
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:21,197
I was really making an effort
not to badmouth people.

74
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,825
"Right, this is just where I am now."

75
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:25,577
"I'm at their level."

76
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,748
"When the time comes and I'm ready,
I'll find myself around better people."

77
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,750
I decided to think that way.

78
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,961
But after a long, hard day,
it's not so different at home.

79
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,270
I want to live alone
and use the air-conditioner all I want.

80
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,148
Somewhere I can't hear
anyone else's voice.

81
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:03,406
Just like you, Gu.

82
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,408
Someone who lives alone.

83
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:12,749
By the way,
how did you end up moving here?

84
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,963
No one moves into the neighborhood.
People only move out.

85
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,507
Do you know someone around here?

86
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,390
No.

87
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:30,350
How did you end up here, then?

88
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:35,730
Did you live in the area
when you were young?

89
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,817
I got off at the wrong stop.

90
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,444
Sorry?

91
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,247
That son of a…

92
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,670
Why the hell did you lock the door?
There's nothing to steal in there!

93
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,965
I didn't lock it!

94
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,299
That little…

95
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,679
See you later.

96
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,981
You're just going to leave?

97
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:46,843
I told you to wash your hair
before going to bed!

98
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,262
You two always hog the bathroom
in the mornings.

99
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,439
I keep telling you
we need another bathroom.

100
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,862
We won't need two bathrooms
once you all move out.

101
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,201
Move out within a year.
And into a place with two bathrooms!

102
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:38,144
ALPHA RETAIL

103
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:39,604
I went through the same thing.

104
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,358
So I go to the store
I hate to visit the most first.

105
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,861
When I was new, I'd visit them last.

106
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,199
But you know how uncomfortable you feel
until you visit the store.

107
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:54,327
So it's better
to make it your first stop of the day.

108
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:58,706
But still, you shouldn't
have said that to the store owners.

109
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,334
I didn't tell them that.

110
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:09,050
She says she wants a different manager,
but we can't just do that.

111
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:10,218
Just talk to her.

112
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,595
Have you called her?

113
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,099
She won't answer my calls
or return my messages.

114
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,227
You'll just have to
keep trying until she does.

115
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,482
Something felt weird yesterday.

116
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,652
Every owner asked
which store I went to first.

117
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,405
I asked them why,

118
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:32,031
and they said A-reum told them

119
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,701
that I always visit
the person I hate the most first.

120
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,749
You should tell her
to mind her own business.

121
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,086
She's not in charge of them anymore.

122
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,505
Why does she still see them
and cause this trouble?

123
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,678
Do you think she's trying to keep you
in check because of the promotion?

124
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:57,015
Damn it.

125
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,851
Hey, it's going to be okay.

126
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:03,354
Fighting and making up with
store owners is 70 percent of our job.

127
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:05,523
This won't affect the promotion.

128
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:08,610
I do usually go to the store
I hate to visit the most first.

129
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,944
But not yesterday.

130
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,572
The owner there works alone all night,

131
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:16,659
so I went there first so she could
go home early and get some rest.

132
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:41,935
Hello--

133
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,061
Thank you.

134
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:45,480
Thank you for answering my call.

135
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,068
No, I'm not that good at acting.

136
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,529
I can't walk into a place I don't like
with a smile and chat like that.

137
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,989
I can't do that.

138
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:58,785
Honestly, it's Ms. Choi's shop
that I have the hardest time dealing with.

139
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,829
I wouldn't even be so upset
if people knew, because it's true.

140
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:05,249
But this misunderstanding with you…
It's just not true.

141
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,836
GYEONGDONG RICE BOWLS

142
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,422
Someone really needs
to tear A-reum a new one.

143
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,300
She does things
knowing she'll cause trouble.

144
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,762
She wants there to be trouble.
She destroys relationships.

145
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,848
I want to eat everything here.

146
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,811
I'll have this. Extra large.

147
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,562
Me too.

148
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,356
-Two extra larges, please.
-Sure.

149
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,653
A-reum talks too much. Way too much.

150
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:36,906
If I die,
make sure you file a petition online.

151
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,367
"A man dies of stress
listening to a chatterbox."

152
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:43,287
Why is a day at the office
even harder than being outside?

153
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:47,041
I have to hear everything that happened
in the past week, including what she ate.

154
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,460
It's an illness.
She'll go crazy if she can't talk.

155
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:52,422
But she doesn't know
that it drives me crazy. She's so selfish.

156
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:57,093
I'd rather get a call from Byeon Sang-mi
than hear her babbling on. It's that bad.

157
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,222
And when I come in early,

158
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,975
I have to listen to exactly
the same story three times.

159
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:07,020
She tells me,
then Mr. Kim, and then Mr. Baek.

160
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,771
The same exact story three times.

161
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,983
And she gets upset
if I don't remember any of it.

162
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,527
"I told you this,
but you obviously forgot."

163
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,320
"You don't care about me, do you?"

164
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:17,613
Why would I even care?

165
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:23,077
And it's not like
we can swap seats like in school.

166
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:25,913
It drives me insane.
It makes me want to jump out the window.

167
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,916
I have to get promoted this time.

168
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,795
A promotion is the only way
to get away from A-reum.

169
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,172
Excuse me.

170
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,339
Thank you.

171
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,301
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

172
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,512
This is a lot.

173
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:45,433
You should really
give her a piece of your mind this time.

174
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,518
-I won't.
-Hey.

175
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:51,397
I know if I grill her about this,
she'll have nothing to say for herself.

176
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,858
So why am I not going to do it?

177
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:58,112
I don't want to sink to her level.
I'm going to get out of this place.

178
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,448
I'm not going to stoop to her level.

179
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,617
That's why I won't do it.

180
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,706
I'd love to work
with good, decent people too.

181
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,832
So why can't I?

182
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,002
It means I'm not decent myself.

183
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,547
Why? Like attracts like. It's science.

184
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:20,593
It sucks, but this is my level.

185
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,973
If I were a decent person, there's no way
I'd be working with someone like A-reum.

186
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:26,891
Why?

187
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,310
Because it's scientifically impossible.

188
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:31,437
That's why I always tell myself,

189
00:14:31,521 --> 00:14:34,482
"I should be a decent person
instead of hoping she'll become one."

190
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,110
It's like spiritual training.

191
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:42,907
Damn it.

192
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:45,243
Crap.

193
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,619
What?

194
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,373
Do I talk too much too?

195
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,375
It feels like I'm the only one talking.

196
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,504
If you think I talk too much,
you have to tell me. Okay?

197
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,005
Yes, just eat.

198
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:01,843
Gosh.

199
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,636
How horrifying.

200
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,686
Everyone. Come look.

201
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,068
RECOMMENDED CLUBS
THE LIBERATION CLUB

202
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,736
THE LIBERATION CLUB

203
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,905
"The Liberation Club"? What's that?

204
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,407
Let's see who's in it.

205
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,368
MEMBERS
PARK SANG-MIN, CHO TAE-HUN, YEOM MI-JEONG

206
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:30,955
No way. It looks like
they randomly tossed it together.

207
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,375
What do you do in The Liberation Club?

208
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,044
Liberation.

209
00:15:37,128 --> 00:15:39,464
So what exactly do you do?

210
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,091
Liberation.

211
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,597
I'm not so sure either.

212
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:50,266
-Come on.
-Come on.

213
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:54,937
Did you just make a fake club so
the support center would stop calling you?

214
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,275
We're really going to do it.

215
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,944
So let's hear it then. What do you do?

216
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:03,279
You must do something.

217
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,406
What do you do together?

218
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,576
We don't do anything together.

219
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,328
We do it individually.

220
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,829
What do you do individually?

221
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:22,215
I'm going to break free.

222
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:25,259
From what?

223
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:27,803
From here.

224
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,597
To where?

225
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,439
To there.

226
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,151
-Come on.
-Come on.

227
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,917
Why would I install
a 400,000-won kitchen sink

228
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,378
when the rent is just 300,000 won?

229
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:03,548
Do you think I just collect rent
and don't spend any money?

230
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,968
When a tenant moves out, I have to hang
new wallpaper and clean the place.

231
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,844
That's not a small amount of money!

232
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,180
The Black Rose Hair Salon
only paid 300,000 won.

233
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,057
So why is it 400,000 won for me?

234
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,186
They only installed the lower cabinets
without the upper ones.

235
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,521
I saw it for myself.

236
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,690
It looked exactly the same
as this one. Jeez.

237
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:23,442
No, they didn't install
the upper cabinets.

238
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,111
Whatever.

239
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:27,405
You think you can fool me
because I'm an old man?

240
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:30,491
Forget it. Just rip it out!
Take it all back!

241
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,577
Wait. Sir--

242
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,197
What is it?

243
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,658
I'll be back in a bit.

244
00:18:12,742 --> 00:18:13,659
Where are you going?

245
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:28,299
Where is Mr. Gu going?

246
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,159
Who is it?

247
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,248
SANPO SINKS

248
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,578
How did you get him to pay?
I don't know how to thank you.

249
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,872
Come and have dinner. I've set the table--

250
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,374
You're skipping dinner again? Come eat!

251
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:57,671
My gosh.

252
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,465
-I'm home.
-Hey.

253
00:20:08,432 --> 00:20:13,395
I wonder how he managed
to get that nasty old man to pay.

254
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:17,357
Old fogies like him are
usually no match for young men.

255
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:20,027
Still, don't say that about your elders.

256
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,824
Maybe you should call him.

257
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:27,743
I doubt he beat it out of him.

258
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:31,789
Don't call him
and make a fool out of Mr. Gu.

259
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,582
Still. Whenever he needs something

260
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:37,211
the old man always comes to us
instead of other businesses.

261
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:40,297
Because it's cheap.
Because you let him haggle all the time.

262
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,007
Because you do whatever he wants.

263
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:17,000
She said you seemed
to like sweet potato stems.

264
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,752
So she sent some.

265
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,054
Why are you so moody?

266
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,937
You're okay one minute and cold the next.

267
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:40,941
You two are the same.

268
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:45,070
You and your dad.

269
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,156
I mean…

270
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,993
Why do you act
like you've done something wrong

271
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,328
when you're asking for
what's rightfully yours?

272
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:00,794
Want me to get it back for you?

273
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,217
If you keep being nice,
he won't pay you back.

274
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,473
Taking things to the extreme
with people you used to know…

275
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,476
Not everyone can do it.

276
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,396
Even if I don't get my money back,

277
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,108
stooping so low and ending up
on the same level as them

278
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,736
is much harder for me.

279
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,210
I'm sorry.

280
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,880
I'm just a drunk after all.

281
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:53,096
To each one's own.

282
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,893
I don't ever intend to change…

283
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:01,897
and neither do you.

284
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:45,190
<i>I said, get off!</i>

285
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:49,820
<i>By the way,
how did you end up moving here?</i>

286
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:54,074
<i>I got off at the wrong stop.</i>

287
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,966
This is perfect for vacation.

288
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,511
Once it's wet, the color will
look darker and different in photos.

289
00:24:15,178 --> 00:24:18,765
You should pick bathing suits in colors
that won't change much when they're wet.

290
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:19,725
White or black.

291
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,019
Mi-jeong, what color is your bikini?

292
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,314
I don't have a bikini.

293
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,526
Is it a one-piece then?

294
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:31,528
Yes.

295
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:33,071
What's with you?

296
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:35,031
I thought you were going to be liberated?

297
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:36,616
What color is it?

298
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,161
Navy.

299
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:42,956
Gosh.

300
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:48,044
Hey, just get this. The white one.

301
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,672
It's going to be see-through.
The models have been waxed.

302
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,048
-What do you know?
-Hey…

303
00:24:58,555 --> 00:24:59,514
You guys go ahead.

304
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,391
Where are you going?

305
00:25:01,475 --> 00:25:02,934
Somewhere.

306
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,441
SEOCHO 1-DONG COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

307
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:41,598
-Damn it.
-My goodness. You should take it slow.

308
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:44,601
I'm rushing things because I'm tired.

309
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:47,145
I can't take it slow.

310
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,065
Gosh, why am I so tired?

311
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,735
I mean, my blood pressure is normal.

312
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,946
Should I get a blood test?

313
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,365
What is wrong with me?

314
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:02,160
I'm short of breath
and I just feel so tired.

315
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,704
Maybe your bra is too small.

316
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,624
Actually…

317
00:26:08,124 --> 00:26:10,710
all your clothes seem too tight.

318
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,173
When you put on weight,
you need to wear bigger clothes,

319
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,551
but many women insist
on wearing the same size.

320
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:21,388
You buy clothes in the same size, right?

321
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,433
I don't buy clothes.

322
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,603
How much weight have you gained?

323
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:31,982
I don't know. I don't weigh myself.

324
00:26:32,065 --> 00:26:33,400
My goodness.

325
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,027
How could you not weigh yourself?

326
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:38,446
Don't you weigh yourself every morning?

327
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,075
-I don't do it either.
-Oh, my.

328
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,329
Why would I do that
every morning and ruin my day?

329
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,210
I just tell myself that today is the most
beautiful and thinnest I'll ever be.

330
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:06,683
Under Article 33 of the Statistics Act,

331
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,852
your information
will be kept confidential.

332
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:12,063
We'd appreciate it
if you can spare a moment of your time.

333
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,984
Let's continue the tourism survey
through the weekend,

334
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,069
and push the agents more.

335
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,614
-Yes, sir.
-And…

336
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,368
I usually buy ten lottery tickets a week
to give out to the staff,

337
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:29,080
but this week all ten of them are yours.

338
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,875
Gosh, that many?

339
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:35,545
You're finally giving me lottery tickets.

340
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:38,214
It must have been hard
to fight against your subconscious.

341
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:44,346
-I'll just take five.
-Come on.

342
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,723
I got them for you. Please take them all.

343
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:48,850
I'm never lucky with these things.

344
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,227
I don't want all of them to be a waste.

345
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:52,520
Just take them.

346
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,522
So it feels like a proper apology.

347
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,817
Apologize for what? It was subconscious.

348
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:01,238
-Come on now.
-All right, I'll stop.

349
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:02,906
Thank you.

350
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,870
I hope I win the jackpot
and pass out from the shock.

351
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:14,459
I'm so tired, but I can't even pass out
or get so much as a nosebleed.

352
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:18,004
I sound like I'm sleep-talking.
I'm so out of it.

353
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,632
I'm sorry. I just feel so weak.

354
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,551
I don't know why.
Maybe my period is coming--

355
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,887
God, what am I saying?

356
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,139
I'm sorry. I'm really out of it today.

357
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,520
Take a deep breath. Slowly. Come on.

358
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,486
Once more. Slowly.

359
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:47,909
When you're tired, take deep breaths.

360
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:49,911
It makes you feel a little better.

361
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,205
You feel better, right?

362
00:28:56,751 --> 00:29:00,005
I want to shave off my hair. All of it.

363
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,343
I mean, my hair has never made me
look any better,

364
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:07,971
but I hold on to it
as if it's a symbol of my femininity.

365
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:12,225
I wash it and blow-dry it every morning
until my arms are tired.

366
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,813
It feels like I've been struggling
over something meaningless all my life.

367
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:19,733
If I shave it off,
I won't have any more false hopes,

368
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:21,693
and it'll make me feel that much lighter.

369
00:29:23,153 --> 00:29:24,904
If I shave my head, will you fire me?

370
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:28,283
I thought you said
you'd love anyone this winter.

371
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,161
If you shave your head, no one will…

372
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,372
Well, not right now. In winter.

373
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:36,916
I'm going to do at least one of them.

374
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,253
I'm so tired that
I even find it annoying that I have hair.

375
00:29:40,337 --> 00:29:41,713
Everything bothers me.

376
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,676
I wish I could take apart my arms, legs,
and head at night, clean them, oil them,

377
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720
and put them back together in the morning.

378
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:53,141
That's the reason why

379
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:55,310
I never stop loving.

380
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,731
You never get tired
as long as you're in love.

381
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,696
I feel embarrassed.

382
00:30:08,865 --> 00:30:10,033
I'm sorry.

383
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,523
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

384
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,114
<i>I want to be pretty.</i>

385
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,399
What's funny?

386
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:28,111
I just realized something strange.

387
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,239
When I think to myself,
I speak so politely.

388
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,951
Why is Hyeon-a late?

389
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,704
It's quite windy today.

390
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,457
Perhaps there's a storm coming.

391
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,960
You've found someone…

392
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:46,963
haven't you?

393
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,175
I haven't.

394
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:51,551
Yes, you have.

395
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,261
What do you want to eat?

396
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,180
Anything.

397
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:56,473
When is your vacation?

398
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,266
I haven't decided yet.

399
00:31:58,349 --> 00:31:59,225
Why not?

400
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:00,810
I don't have anywhere to go.

401
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,062
I'll just save it for later.

402
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:05,523
All right. I'll join you then.

403
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,942
What about your part-time job?

404
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:08,860
I quit.

405
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:10,737
-Why?
-I got fired.

406
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,700
I fought with a customer.
He swore at me as soon as he sat down.

407
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:22,957
People who live in tall buildings
like that must be mentally strong.

408
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,295
They could end it all in one step,
but they don't.

409
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,759
Not because their lives are hard,
but in the spur of the moment.

410
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:34,636
They can end it when they feel like it.

411
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:38,515
That's why I still live in a basement.

412
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,809
Basements are much safer.

413
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,022
-You want more ketchup?
-Yes.

414
00:32:52,612 --> 00:32:55,156
I know it's hard,
but don't think about moving out.

415
00:32:56,157 --> 00:32:58,159
You'll enjoy it for a while,

416
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:00,286
but your life can become a mess
in an instant.

417
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,541
It's so cold. I feel like
my skull is going to crack open.

418
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,292
Turn it off then.

419
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,170
I can't find the remote control.

420
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,423
I can only turn it on and off.
The temperature is set at 18°C.

421
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:16,844
Clean your house. You'll find it then.

422
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:31,818
I left all my nice things
at that jerk's place.

423
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,947
All my pretty clothes are there too.

424
00:33:37,657 --> 00:33:38,658
Go get them.

425
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,747
I don't know how to end it.

426
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,834
I haven't made up my mind yet.

427
00:33:55,967 --> 00:34:00,305
We've already broken up dozens of times.

428
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,933
So why do I hit rock bottom
every time we break up?

429
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,562
And why does it always
feel like it's the first time?

430
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,191
Just stay with him then.

431
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,152
No.

432
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,572
There's no more love for me to give him.
I used it all up.

433
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:26,706
I'm just going to
keep wanting until the day I die.

434
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:31,794
"Love me."

435
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:33,463
"I'll love you back."

436
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,298
"Love me more."

437
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,634
"I'll love you more too."

438
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,803
"I don't need any presents

439
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,431
or surprise events."

440
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:48,936
"Just give me love.
I'm still hungry. Give me more."

441
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,274
Jeez, all the love in the world
wouldn't be enough for me.

442
00:34:58,863 --> 00:34:59,864
Mi-jeong.

443
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:02,867
Don't ask for love like me.

444
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,624
You've found someone, right?

445
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:17,632
Just give him everything, okay?
Give him everything like a warrior.

446
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,718
Just set off an explosion with your love.

447
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:28,101
Never ask for love like me.

448
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,040
Yes, okay. I got it.

449
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,169
He's on his way now.

450
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:37,879
Let's hurry and finish cleaning.

451
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:38,880
-Okay!
-Okay!

452
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,257
I wish the president visited every day.

453
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,967
You've made the store so clean.

454
00:36:49,682 --> 00:36:51,559
INCOMING CALL
STORE OWNER BYEON SANG-MI

455
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:13,414
Right.

456
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:15,082
Of course.

457
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:16,876
Yes, I know.

458
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:30,139
Leave him be. It's part of his job.

459
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:35,895
Okay, good night.

460
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:37,980
Hang in there.

461
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:39,732
Bye.

462
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,863
Damn, one hour and thirteen minutes?

463
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:12,974
Do you want seconds?

464
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,981
Look.

465
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,484
How long are you going to live?

466
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,121
How long are you going to live?

467
00:38:37,123 --> 00:38:39,917
How would I know how long I'll live?

468
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,461
Kids your generation will live to 100.

469
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:45,840
That means you still have
60 to 70 more years to go.

470
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:47,800
What's your plan?

471
00:38:55,308 --> 00:38:56,350
To live well.

472
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,689
What else can I do other than that?

473
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,318
How can you plan for 60 to 70 years?
Even the government can't do that.

474
00:39:05,401 --> 00:39:09,280
Then are you going to live
all those years without a plan?

475
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,408
How can you possibly make plans
for that long in the future?

476
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:15,786
If I were to live 60 to 70 more years,
a lot of things could happen.

477
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,581
Why should I make plans
that may not even come true?

478
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,834
I hate it when people ask
children about their dreams.

479
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:24,211
What dreams?
Your CSAT score decides those.

480
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:27,548
You can't go
to med school with 320 points.

481
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:31,260
You're living like that
because you have no plan!

482
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:34,180
You're wasting your life
listening to some woman's grievances.

483
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:45,274
Why do you spend time
listening to someone else's grievances?

484
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:46,400
You call that work?

485
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,112
I have a colleague that's even worse.
She's not that bad compared to her.

486
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:55,201
Let's just eat.

487
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:05,628
You keep wasting time like that
because you have no plans.

488
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,844
Have you lived your life
the way you planned?

489
00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:19,308
You have two daughters who only make you
worry and a son who never listens to you.

490
00:40:19,392 --> 00:40:22,853
You have two jobs,
but you can't even afford your own car.

491
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:25,564
You have to work
without air-conditioning in summer.

492
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,275
Is this the kind of life
you planned for yourself?

493
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:32,822
Is it? Say something!

494
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,371
Damn it. I'm hungry.

495
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:42,206
I should've finished my meal.

496
00:40:42,832 --> 00:40:44,583
Go back in and eat then.

497
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,545
Come with me.

498
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:49,296
I already ate.

499
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,548
Can't you eat more?

500
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,553
You always try to bring me home
when you're in trouble.

501
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:56,470
Go home, man.

502
00:40:57,304 --> 00:40:58,472
Damn it.

503
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:07,481
<i>The crystal bracelet
comes with a necklace and earrings.</i>

504
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,027
<i>This is an unbelievably good deal.</i>

505
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,654
<i>You can see the pattern engraved</i>

506
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,740
<i>even on the back.</i>

507
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:22,163
<i>An internationally renowned craftsman
affixed them one by one by hand.</i>

508
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,331
<i>No matter which direction
you look at it from,</i>

509
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,710
<i>it shines so beautifully.</i>

510
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:32,048
<i>Whenever you wear this bracelet,
I'm sure all eyes will be on you.</i>

511
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:33,799
<i>You will feel it.</i>

512
00:41:33,883 --> 00:41:37,344
<i>And the surface that surrounds your wrist</i>

513
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,388
<i>is made of 14k gold.</i>

514
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:41,265
<i>-Three players were there.
-Yes.</i>

515
00:41:41,348 --> 00:41:44,518
<i>I'd say it was a pretty good attempt,</i>

516
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,980
<i>but it would've been better
if he'd passed to another player.</i>

517
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:52,860
<i>Realistically speaking, it'll be hard
to turn the tables at this point.</i>

518
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,028
<i>That's right.</i>

519
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,573
<i>When we watch the match again…</i>

520
00:42:02,411 --> 00:42:04,330
KITCHEN SINKS, CLOSET
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

521
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,421
My gosh.

522
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:20,387
<i>It's raining hard.</i>

523
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:31,774
<i>Should we cancel tonight?</i>

524
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:34,110
MANAGER CHO TAE-HUN

525
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,448
<i>It's our first gathering, so we should.</i>

526
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,409
<i>We shouldn't cancel our first meeting.</i>

527
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,664
<i>Right? Is it okay with you, Mi-jeong?</i>

528
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:49,542
<i>Yes, I'm up for it.</i>

529
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:51,961
<i>By the way,</i>

530
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:54,797
<i>we're a group of people
who want to be liberated,</i>

531
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,508
<i>so I think it should be
a comfortable gathering.</i>

532
00:42:58,384 --> 00:43:00,845
<i>Can we meet somewhere
where we're not face-to-face?</i>

533
00:43:07,893 --> 00:43:10,855
Somehow, I feel uncomfortable
when I sit across from other people.

534
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,817
Sitting face-to-face…

535
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:18,154
feels a little aggressive.

536
00:43:19,572 --> 00:43:21,574
I feel like I have to
fill the silences too.

537
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:26,078
Do you feel uncomfortable
sitting like this?

538
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:29,498
No.

539
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:32,084
It's nice and relaxing.

540
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,463
There's nothing to it.

541
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,676
To be liberated, I'll have to
quit my job and get a divorce.

542
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,557
I've done one of them,

543
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:50,811
but it didn't exactly liberate me.

544
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:53,355
I'm sorry.

545
00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:57,860
There will be people
who frustrate you anywhere you go,

546
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,447
and those people will never change.

547
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,449
Then that means it's me who has to change.

548
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,036
but I don't want to
let go of this anger I feel.

549
00:44:08,996 --> 00:44:10,539
My anger is perfectly reasonable.

550
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:12,708
It is all too reasonable.

551
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:17,046
It's so hard to suppress
this reasonable anger each time.

552
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:21,717
There are people who suck at their jobs
but don't want to be criticized.

553
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,136
They call me condescending
whenever I open my mouth.

554
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,806
So I tell myself to just hold it in.

555
00:44:30,017 --> 00:44:31,477
You're doing a good job.

556
00:44:33,228 --> 00:44:34,271
Does it show?

557
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,984
AMUR DERMATOLOGY CLINIC

558
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:42,446
Botox injections to the salivary glands
can make your jawline smoother.

559
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:46,617
The high-frequency mega-cell 500
will tighten your skin from the inside.

560
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,497
And for sunken eyes, you can rebuild
collagen using salmon DNA injections.

561
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,498
With these,

562
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:55,834
you can easily make yourself look
15 years younger without surgery.

563
00:44:55,918 --> 00:44:59,046
By the way, do you usually speak
this quietly in a barbecue restaurant?

564
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:02,675
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

565
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:04,802
Take a look.

566
00:45:05,552 --> 00:45:07,763
-Oh, boy.
-Pretty bad, right?

567
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:10,933
But after the three treatments
I told you about…

568
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,185
AFTER TREATMENT

569
00:45:13,268 --> 00:45:17,523
It's the same person, but doesn't she
look much younger and livelier?

570
00:45:17,606 --> 00:45:21,151
You see, when you were little, and
someone told you to draw an old person,

571
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,904
you'd draw lines over here, right?

572
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:25,823
We're getting rid of those lines.

573
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:27,116
Like this.

574
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,034
CONSULTANT
CHO GYEONG-SEON

575
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:32,830
You don't have prominent lines
around your lips.

576
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,416
You'll look much younger by just
removing the lines under your eyes.

577
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,044
We recently treated a celebrity as well.

578
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:41,171
I see.

579
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,758
Excuse me.

580
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,010
Yes?

581
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:48,929
Did you go to Sanpo Girls' High School,
by any chance?

582
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:51,390
Yes.

583
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,437
Who…

584
00:45:58,605 --> 00:45:59,440
"Yeom Gi-jeong."

585
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:03,068
-Wait, are you Yeom Gi-jeong?
-Yes.

586
00:46:03,152 --> 00:46:06,989
Oh, my God. I do know Yeom Gi-jeong.
But who are you?

587
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:09,241
Right.

588
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,202
I think I saw you a few weeks ago.

589
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:13,454
Where?

590
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,205
At a barbecue restaurant in Gangnam.

591
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:17,750
What?

592
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,377
I think it was your niece's birthday.

593
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:22,546
That place?

594
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,466
Then you should've said hi.
Why didn't you?

595
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,967
What?

596
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,928
How did you recognize me right away?

597
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,638
Well…

598
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:37,352
I gave you a really good price.
Even I can't do it at that price.

599
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:42,649
-You never brought a friend from Sanpo.
-Yes, it's my first time meeting one.

600
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,860
We don't really talk about Sanpo.

601
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:47,279
It was a dark time
for me and my two siblings.

602
00:46:47,863 --> 00:46:49,823
You know I have a younger brother, right?

603
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,783
Yes.

604
00:46:50,866 --> 00:46:53,035
You remember a lot about me.

605
00:46:53,118 --> 00:46:55,079
How do you even remember that?

606
00:46:56,038 --> 00:47:00,292
She recognized me straight away
when she saw me on Yu-rim's birthday.

607
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,211
You should've said hi then.

608
00:47:02,294 --> 00:47:03,712
Where in Sanpo do you live?

609
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:07,174
Near Dangmi Station, not in the new town.

610
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:08,801
Near that reservoir?

611
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:10,135
Yes.

612
00:47:10,219 --> 00:47:12,554
Isn't there a famous <i>sujebi</i> place
around there?

613
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:14,807
Yes, there is.

614
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,684
Our aunt used to take us there sometimes.

615
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:19,311
Is it still there?

616
00:47:19,394 --> 00:47:20,395
Yes.

617
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,356
I want to go back there sometime.

618
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,900
I think of their <i>sujebi</i> from time to time.

619
00:47:25,484 --> 00:47:26,860
She called it dining-out,

620
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,113
but it was just boring old <i>sujebi</i>.

621
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:32,074
Still, we've gotten where we are
all thanks to Auntie.

622
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,993
Without her, we wouldn't have known
about the inheritance tax,

623
00:47:35,077 --> 00:47:38,080
or how we were supposed to cough up
such a large sum of money.

624
00:47:39,748 --> 00:47:41,750
We rented out
the apartment on the third floor,

625
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:45,671
paid the inheritance tax with that money,
and moved in with our aunt.

626
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:49,967
All our relatives tried to take
this building away from us, remember?

627
00:47:50,676 --> 00:47:53,846
You should know
that auntie did her best to protect us.

628
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,430
Was that why the food was so horrible?

629
00:47:55,514 --> 00:47:56,890
Her family ate the same food.

630
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,685
No, they'd always go out to eat
by themselves.

631
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,939
Now that I have
a niece of my own, I get it.

632
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:07,317
I find her so precious and adorable.
How could she treat us like that?

633
00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:11,321
Yu-rim is little, but we weren't.

634
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:14,158
You think you'll still find her adorable
when she's older?

635
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,368
Yes. I'll find her adorable forever.

636
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,208
It looks like we have a similar skin type.
Those bruises won't go away quickly.

637
00:48:24,293 --> 00:48:25,919
They will if you don't drink.

638
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:34,094
-Hi, Yu-rim!
-Hey.

639
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:37,598
Look at you. You're all wet.

640
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:41,727
Hey, this is my friend from high school.

641
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:46,023
She saw us at the barbecue restaurant
on Yu-rim's birthday.

642
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:56,200
Yu-rim, did you have dinner?

643
00:48:56,992 --> 00:48:57,993
Aren't you hungry?

644
00:48:58,076 --> 00:48:58,911
Yu-rim.

645
00:48:58,994 --> 00:49:00,871
You'll have to excuse her. Puberty.

646
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:04,958
Kids grow up fast these days.

647
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:09,880
-Oh, welcome!
-Welcome!

648
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:10,797
Welcome.

649
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:35,197
Hey.

650
00:49:35,864 --> 00:49:38,158
I'm sorry. I really am,

651
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,911
but he could never get married again.

652
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,413
Cho Gyeong-seon used to be delinquent.

653
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:47,167
Close siblings, one of whom
used to be delinquent? It's over.

654
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,628
No woman would want
to get in the middle of that.

655
00:49:49,711 --> 00:49:52,547
I can see why he got divorced.
It's so obvious.

656
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,551
When it comes to marriage,
the three of us are much better.

657
00:49:56,635 --> 00:49:59,096
We'd just ignore each other
outside of the house.

658
00:49:59,888 --> 00:50:02,140
Three close siblings without parents?

659
00:50:02,224 --> 00:50:04,309
No one wants that. Jeez.

660
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,771
Turn off the light.

661
00:50:09,022 --> 00:50:11,984
Oh, hey. Watch him closely
and see if he disappears or not.

662
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:17,698
I should still get my share.

663
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:25,580
-Here.
-Oh, no. It's fine.

664
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:28,166
I told Gyeong-seon
that this one was on me.

665
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:30,085
Well…

666
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:32,921
Let her pay. I gave her a good price
for her wrinkle treatment.

667
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:36,633
She's right. Here you go.

668
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:39,511
You can just pay for the drinks then.

669
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:42,723
No, please ring up everything,
the bean sprouts and all.

670
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:44,850
I'll just ring up the drinks.

671
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:50,897
Please come again.

672
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,908
Here you go.

673
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,076
Thanks.

674
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,119
Thank you.

675
00:51:04,202 --> 00:51:06,747
Here. It's a gift.

676
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:11,668
I'm really sorry about that day.

677
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:13,920
No. It's okay.

678
00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:18,508
Just take them. Someone gave it to me,
but I'm never lucky with these.

679
00:51:21,136 --> 00:51:23,680
If you win,
I'd suggest you go off the grid,

680
00:51:23,764 --> 00:51:25,140
or else I'll mooch off you.

681
00:51:36,276 --> 00:51:40,572
<i>To you, the most important thing
is his attitude toward life.</i>

682
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:42,574
<i>You look at his core.</i>

683
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,374
Have you gone mad?

684
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:55,504
He's Gyeong-seon's little brother.
He's a single father.

685
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:00,592
Please come again.

686
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:02,803
<i>Come again.</i>

687
00:52:08,016 --> 00:52:08,892
Have you lost it?

688
00:52:08,975 --> 00:52:11,436
Of course he'd say that.
He owns the place.

689
00:53:06,158 --> 00:53:08,910
<i>Mi-jeong, why did you think
of The Liberation Club?</i>

690
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,250
My gosh.

691
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:21,006
<i>People are scared
of thunder and lightning,</i>

692
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,258
<i>but strangely</i>

693
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:25,635
<i>I find them calming.</i>

694
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:30,015
<i>"The world might finally come to an end…</i>

695
00:53:31,516 --> 00:53:32,893
<i>as I wished."</i>

696
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,360
<i>It feels like I'm stuck,
but I don't know how to get out.</i>

697
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:45,780
<i>That's probably why I hope
everything ends all at once.</i>

698
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,826
<i>"I'm not unhappy
but I'm not happy either."</i>

699
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,872
<i>"I wouldn't care if the world ended now."</i>

700
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,763
<i>"Everyone is on their way to their graves,</i>

701
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:12,432
<i>so why is everyone so happy and excited?"</i>

702
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:20,232
<i>Sometimes, I think
that people who are damaged</i>

703
00:54:20,315 --> 00:54:25,862
<i>are much more honest
than those who live their lives happily.</i>

704
00:55:05,527 --> 00:55:06,361
Get inside!

705
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:09,948
Get inside now!

706
00:55:14,869 --> 00:55:16,037
I said, get inside!

707
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:52,073
<i>I don't know where I'm stuck
but I want to break free.</i>

708
00:55:53,241 --> 00:55:57,287
<i>I wish I was genuinely happy</i>

709
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:02,292
<i>and be able to say things like,
"Yes, this is life."</i>

710
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:04,628
<i>"This is what life is all about."</i>

711
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,047
<i>I want to be able to say these things.</i>

712
00:56:25,774 --> 00:56:29,194
SANPO SINKS

713
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:32,530
You should go check on him.

714
00:56:33,114 --> 00:56:34,908
Just let him rest.

715
00:56:35,575 --> 00:56:39,329
Go check. Maybe he's hurt again
and can't move.

716
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:42,165
Come on.

717
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,712
PHARMACY

718
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:45,478
Do you want to go grab
a cold glass of beer?

719
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:45,997
Do what you can do standing up.
You'll hurt your back too.

720
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:48,917
This is farm work. There's nothing
you can do standing up.

721
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,623
Why didn't you just stay at home?
Your foot isn't healed yet.

722
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,445
Jeez. You should
cross the bridge over there.

723
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:42,780
No, it's faster that way.

724
01:00:42,864 --> 01:00:44,365
It's faster this way.

725
01:00:44,449 --> 01:00:47,535
Can't you eyeball that?
It's faster that way.

726
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:49,037
But…

727
01:00:57,212 --> 01:00:58,129
Wait here.

728
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,467
I'll go.

729
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:10,642
Wait.

730
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:12,769
It's over there.

731
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:19,817
Where is he going?

732
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:28,660
<i>By the way,</i>

733
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,329
<i>how did you end up moving here?</i>

734
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:34,999
<i>I said, get off!</i>

735
01:01:39,587 --> 01:01:42,423
<i>You would've been in trouble
if you had kept going.</i>

736
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,259
<i>How did you know to run?</i>

737
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:51,474
<i>So worship me.</i>

738
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,893
So that when spring comes,

739
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,853
you and I

740
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:58,064
<i>will have become different people.</i>

741
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:07,717
<i>Are you sure?</i>

742
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,178
<i>That you and I</i>

743
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:13,890
<i>will have become
different people when spring comes?</i>

744
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,185
<i>I'm positive.</i>

745
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,772
<i>How do you worship someone?</i>

746
01:03:22,357 --> 01:03:23,316
<i>You cheer them on.</i>

747
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:26,527
<i>You tell them they can do anything</i>

748
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:29,364
<i>and that everything is possible.</i>

749
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,159
<i>You cheer them on.</i>

MY LIBERATION NOTES

752
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:20,623
You used to be a national athlete, right?

753
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:22,625
Gu Jin-seok? Gu Ja-gyeong? Gu Chang-mo?

754
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,086
<i>You hid this for a year?</i>

755
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:28,005
<i>I have nothing to say or hear from you.</i>

756
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:33,636
<i>If Gyeong-seon finds out about that,
you're done for.</i>

757
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,471
I doubt he'll tell her.

758
01:04:35,555 --> 01:04:37,181
<i>His kid will.</i>

759
01:04:37,265 --> 01:04:39,851
<i>It seemed like you'd text her right away.</i>

760
01:04:39,934 --> 01:04:41,352
<i>Haven't you gotten over Ye-rim?</i>

761
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,313
Did you have dinner?
What are you doing later?

762
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,357
Take this.

01:04:48,568 --> 01:04:50,153
<i>He always holds back.</i>

01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:54,532
