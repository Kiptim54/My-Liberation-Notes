8
00:01:26,937 --> 00:01:27,771
Sorry!

9
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,655
Hang on. This is our dad's truck.

10
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,865
Why did I say sorry? Jeez.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,201
What the heck?

12
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,219
SANPO SINKS

13
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:14,359
We're home.

14
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:15,360
Hey.

15
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,904
Wash up quick and come eat, okay?

16
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,073
I'll pass today.

17
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,742
Why? Wash up and come eat, okay?

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,871
Did you eat while you were out?

19
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:28,540
Of course not.

20
00:02:29,124 --> 00:02:31,209
Then why isn't he eating?

21
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,235
Just leave him.

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,487
Why do you keep bothering him?

23
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:02,907
Then what? Just let him starve
when he worked all day?

24
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:07,203
He must want to drink on an empty stomach.

25
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,164
We know he drinks every day.

26
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:12,000
You take care of him every day.
Do you think he loves that?

27
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,961
It's like you're saying,
"Pull yourself together already."

28
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:16,463
He probably feels pressured.

29
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:18,214
Who's pressuring him?

30
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,674
You are, Mom.

31
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,405
<i>I don't know what to take photos of.</i>

32
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:47,744
<i>I saw a tricycle on my way here.</i>

33
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:10,809
<i>Why do you drink every day?</i>

34
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:13,561
<i>What else would I do?</i>

35
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:16,439
<i>Should I give you something to do?</i>

36
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,567
Worship me.

37
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,781
<i>I've never felt whole before.</i>

38
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,576
<i>One asshole after another…</i>

39
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:32,038
Every guy I've ever dated was an asshole.

40
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:35,417
So worship me and make me feel whole.

41
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,130
<i>It'll be winter soon.</i>

42
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:43,800
<i>Nothing survives when winter comes.</i>

43
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:48,263
<i>There will be nothing to see sitting there
and no work at the factory.</i>

44
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:51,474
If you drink all day,
you'll only feel like crap.

45
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:53,351
<i>It'll be like hell.</i>

46
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:56,896
<i>You have to do something.</i>

47
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,608
I want to feel whole for once.

48
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,778
<i>So worship me.</i>

49
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,115
<i>Love isn't enough.</i>

50
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,118
<i>Worship me.</i>

51
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:30,597
Go home.

52
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,057
Go home and sleep.

53
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,476
You have nothing to do anyway.

54
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,395
Do you think I want to do anything?

55
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,151
Do you know my name?

56
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,530
Do you know anything about me?

57
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,996
Why do you think
I'm living quietly in this countryside…

58
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:58,416
without telling anyone my name?

59
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:05,465
I don't want anything to do…

60
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,301
with anyone.

61
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,012
Not a thing.

62
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,699
Why are you still here?
Are you not going home?

63
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,287
I don't want to go home.

64
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,256
You don't want to go home?
What's gotten into you?

65
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,509
I've never heard you
say you don't want to go home.

66
00:06:49,592 --> 00:06:51,386
Where should we go? A bar?

67
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,224
It looks delicious.

68
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,686
So tell me, why don't you want to go home?

69
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:02,730
Just because.

70
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,982
There you go again.

71
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,442
You always dodge questions like that.

72
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,778
Before I beat you up to make you spill,

73
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,904
just tell us.

74
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,410
There's this guy

75
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,038
that eats at my house.
And it's uncomfortable.

76
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,623
He eats there? Who is he?

77
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,624
Is he good-looking?

78
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,209
What does he do? How old is he?

79
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,128
I don't know, either.

80
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,754
-What?
-What?

81
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,384
I really don't know.

82
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,595
I don't even know his name.

83
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,889
I don't even know his name,

84
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:39,309
yet I made a huge mistake.

85
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,893
So what kind of mistake?

86
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:49,277
Spill it already! Spill! Now!

87
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,825
You lent a guy money, didn't you?

88
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,664
Guys can be sly as a fox too.

89
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,795
He saw that you're the kind of woman
he could borrow money from, screw over,

90
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,590
and get away with it.

91
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:18,473
So stop avoiding it
and deal with the problem at hand.

92
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,812
Once that jerk's paid all the money back,

93
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,732
will my life be fine?

94
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:30,234
I think it will still be the same.

95
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,073
I'll still have never felt whole

96
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:37,450
in this crappy life
with these crappy people

97
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,952
acting like they're so great

98
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,747
and just talking away thoughtlessly.

99
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,625
How they talk…

100
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:56,427
Sorry.

101
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,681
I'm an asshole, too.

102
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,906
Oh, no! The last train!

103
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,827
What?

104
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,373
I really don't want to go home.

105
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,625
Hey.

106
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,585
Just miss the last train.

107
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:32,088
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

108
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:38,094
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

109
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:41,013
-Miss it!
-Miss it!

110
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,307
Asshole.

111
00:09:44,225 --> 00:09:45,226
Idiot.

112
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:47,937
All he ever does is drink every day.

113
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,860
Do you want to win by cheating
your friend like that, asshole?

114
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:54,944
Whatever.

115
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,780
-That's your problem.
-Hey.

116
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:48,975
Mom.

117
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,187
Please, let's turn
the air-conditioner on. Please?

118
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:58,484
Mother. I beg you.

119
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,897
Why has he turned
his back against the world?

120
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,029
<i>The number you have dialed cannot be--</i>

121
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,451
I MADE THIS MONTH'S PAYMENT. CALL ME.

122
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,662
THIS MESSAGE WAS DELETED

123
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,771
She asked if anything's up with you.

124
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:00,773
What's going on?

125
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,903
I got called to the Joy Support Center,

126
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,824
and I cried
because I didn't want to join a club.

127
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:11,534
Goodness.

128
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,369
Just join anything

129
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,080
and say you're too busy to attend.
That'll do it.

130
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,335
She's too straitlaced.

131
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,511
How about joining
the photography club with me?

132
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:33,305
No one drinks, and everyone's really nice.

133
00:14:34,724 --> 00:14:37,810
It must be annoying
to keep being called in over such a thing.

134
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,397
I want to stop learning things.

135
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:46,569
When I learned to swim,
I couldn't swim freestyle.

136
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:49,405
But since there were a lot of us,

137
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,199
we moved on to the backstroke,
then the breaststroke…

138
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,994
School was the same.

139
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:59,457
I hadn't learnt the multiplication table,
but we still had to move on to fractions.

140
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:04,837
After that, I was just sitting there.

141
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,177
In a club, the same thing
will just happen again.

142
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,096
Besides, nothing's fun for me.

143
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,349
I shouldn't have told you

144
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,019
about Su-jin and the others
going on a trip.

145
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,857
You think I'd have fun on a trip?

146
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:32,281
Here you go.

147
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,544
<i>Why are you asking
around for Se-yeong's number?</i>

148
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,089
<i>I've been paying
your money back consistently.</i>

149
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:50,633
<i>I've even worked part-time
to pay it back every month.</i>

150
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,927
<i>It's just this one month I couldn't pay.</i>

151
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:56,180
<i>I'm racking my brain now for a solution.</i>

152
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,850
<i>But if you call Se-yeong,
you can forget about the money.</i>

153
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,061
For God's sake.

154
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,691
Crazy bastard.

155
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:17,409
DESIGN TEAM 3, CHOI JUN-HO

156
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,555
Were you…

157
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:41,475
talking to me?

158
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,443
No.

159
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,196
I was reading my text…

160
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:09,253
I guess he knows he's a bastard. If you're
going to a cafe, let's go together.

161
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,840
No. I'm going to do it at home.
See you tomorrow.

162
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,592
Okay, see you.

163
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,484
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY.
IMMEDIATELY HE SPOKE TO THEM AND SAID,

164
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:34,445
“TAKE COURAGE! IT IS I. DON’T BE AFRAID.”
(MARK 6:50)

165
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,294
I hate this season.

166
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,257
Where the air you breathe in
and breathe out

167
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,176
are the same temperature.

168
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:59,029
Can we get coffee here?

169
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:01,865
Well, you can,

170
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,410
but it doesn't taste all that good.

171
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,496
Should we just go?

172
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,206
Our coffee beans are old.

173
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,083
I'm sorry.

174
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,897
Has anyone come
to take a look at your cafe?

175
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,650
What do you think?

176
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,576
Can't you turn on the air-conditioner?

177
00:20:00,174 --> 00:20:03,302
Is she crazy? Why would she come
to my friend's wedding?

178
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,638
If she broke up with me,
she should be done with my friends too.

179
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:09,516
How could she think
of coming there all dolled up?

180
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,769
And what? "Let's stay friends."

181
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,979
She hurt me so badly.

182
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,315
After saying I'm "unbearably
and disgustingly old-fashioned,"

183
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,067
she wants us to be friends.

184
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,194
Is she insane?
Does she think I'm an idiot?

185
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,071
Sorry.

186
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,407
She said she and that guy weren't a thing,

187
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,701
and they picked up
two more people right after.

188
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:30,954
What does that have to do with me?
Why did she even tell me that?

189
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,792
If it's over, just let it be over.
That's normal.

190
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,168
But her being friendly…

191
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,380
End things beautifully?

192
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:42,591
Don't make me laugh. There's
no such thing as a beautiful breakup.

193
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,511
Then she took it out on me

194
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:46,887
<i>saying I embarrassed her</i>

195
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,389
<i>-in front of others.</i>
-Asshole.

196
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,528
Can't they just get married
without other people?

197
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:06,365
In the past, people went to weddings
to eat food since they were poor.

198
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,242
But they all eat well now.

199
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:10,994
Hey, I'm hungry.

200
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,632
So you live in Uijeongbu?

201
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,259
Yes.

202
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:31,140
Then this is a meeting between
North Gyeonggi-do and South Gyeonggi-do.

203
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:35,561
We have penetrated the egg yolk to meet.

204
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,109
Oh. That's what my brother says.

205
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:45,487
That Gyeonggi-do is like the egg white
wrapped around Seoul,

206
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,406
which is the egg yolk.

207
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:52,578
So we've both come into the yolk to meet.

208
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:56,957
That's funny.

209
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,046
Does it take you about an hour and a half
to get to Seoul from there, too?

210
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,715
Yes.

211
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,342
Right, me too.

212
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,013
A round trip of three hours
for both of us.

213
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:13,891
We might as well go on a trip.

214
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,561
Isn't the commute pretty bad?

215
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,604
It's the worst.

216
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,690
Are you managing?

217
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,275
Not really.

218
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:26,278
I feel like my batteries are
going to run out soon.

219
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,113
Same here.

220
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,157
So I should decide soon

221
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,743
whether to change jobs or move to Seoul.

222
00:22:33,744 --> 00:22:36,914
I'd decide to move to Seoul.

223
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:40,959
You haven't let go of that dream yet?

224
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,629
Have you let go?

225
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:48,467
It's still too early to give up just yet,
so hold on a little longer.

226
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,939
You were saved
in Jeong-su's phone as "Pick-up Girl."

227
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,523
What does that mean?

228
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,277
Oh, that?

229
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,863
"A girl who always picks up the phone"?

230
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:12,616
I asked him, but he said it wasn't that

231
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,868
and told me to ask you directly.

232
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,245
What does it mean?

233
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:18,538
This again.

234
00:23:19,414 --> 00:23:22,125
I'm tearing up, just thinking about it.

235
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,756
Once, with my friends,

236
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:32,844
we were talking about
"What's the noblest romance there is?"

237
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:36,181
And I was reminded of something I saw
in a history book at school,

238
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:42,980
about a woman who ran to pick up the
severed head of her husband in her skirt.

239
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,524
When I was young,
it was too gruesome for me,

240
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,985
but now that I'm older, I think,

241
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:51,780
"Yes, I would pick it up,
no, I'd have to pick it up."

242
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,492
"I can't let it fall to the ground.
I should run and catch it in my skirt."

243
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:56,910
Yes.

244
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,370
Don't you think so?

245
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:00,038
Isn't that only right?

246
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:04,167
And one summer, ages ago,
I spent a short time at Bible Camp.

247
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:07,129
I heard the story
of how Jesus was nailed to the cross,

248
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,424
but weirdly, it was Mary
that my heart went out to.

249
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:12,926
It took about six hours for Jesus to die

250
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,470
after getting whipped
and nailed to the cross.

251
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,141
For those six hours,
Mary followed the entire way

252
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,977
and took Jesus's body down.

253
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:24,730
She's amazing.

254
00:24:26,106 --> 00:24:28,233
I should stay by my partner's side, too.

255
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:58,180
<i>Why would you talk about that?</i>

256
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,561
They'd be too scared about
being beheaded to fall for you.

257
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,147
You need to watch what you say.

258
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,107
Why would you say that
to someone you just met?

259
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,860
Well, he asked.

260
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:12,903
So what?

261
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:16,156
Would you tell him how your poop was
this morning if he asked?

262
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,574
Yes, I'd tell him everything.

263
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:21,286
Just live alone.

264
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,789
Why are you trying so hard
to love just anyone?

265
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:27,042
Don't do it. No one will love you.

266
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,002
No man would fall in love with a woman

267
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:31,421
who says she'd pick up
their lover's severed head.

268
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:36,593
I just mean, if such a thing happens.
Hypothetically.

269
00:25:36,676 --> 00:25:39,554
Exactly, why are you
imagining that situation?

270
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,266
We don't want to be beheaded.
We don't want to imagine that.

271
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,020
Why did you have to
give him such a gruesome example?

272
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,941
That's the noblest romance?
We're not living in that era.

273
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:58,824
She's not looking for a boyfriend,
she's looking for a comrade-in-arms.

274
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:02,160
You must feel so much regret
that you were born in such peaceful times.

275
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:07,124
You must want to charge at enemies
and risk your life to save the country.

276
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,167
So sitting and eating dinner with a guy

277
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,254
must be terribly dull
and unsatisfying for you, right?

278
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,595
All right, then.

279
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,223
One. Women who run away.

280
00:26:23,306 --> 00:26:24,683
Two. Women who faint.

281
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:27,602
Three. Women who pick it up.
Which woman do you want?

282
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,526
Which one would you prefer
out of the three?

283
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,695
Hey, which woman are you?

284
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,284
I'd pick it up too if it came to that.

285
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:44,286
She's a pick-up girl.

286
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,415
Girls who flirt and act all feminine
like Lee Ye-rin would never pick it up.

287
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:50,417
Those kinds of girls would run away.

288
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:52,294
Is that love?

289
00:26:54,504 --> 00:26:58,175
So you're saying
that your man should be beheaded.

290
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,135
Hey, Du-hwan.

291
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,928
We need to start a war.

292
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:04,347
Gi-jeong's man
absolutely must be beheaded.

293
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,434
As long as it's not me.

294
00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:08,894
Oh Du-hwan.

295
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,522
Your name could start a war. Oh Du-hwan.

296
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,109
Yeom Chang-hee. Your name's just as bad.

297
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,238
Mi-jeong, go buy some more alcohol.

298
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:23,742
No.

299
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:25,702
No?

300
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,705
Then go borrow some from Gu.

301
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,168
Just go borrow some already.

302
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:36,671
You bring him food every day.
I'm sure he'll give us some.

303
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,840
Hurry. You and Mr. Gu are close.

304
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:42,344
As if.

305
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,554
Let's just call it a night.

306
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:46,765
We're short by just one drink.
Hurry up and go.

307
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:51,144
There's no alcohol at Mr. Gu's place.
So enough.

308
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:53,563
Why wouldn't there be when he's a drunk?

309
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:57,067
Alcoholics never have alcohol stored away.

310
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,027
They just keep two to three bottles.

311
00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:02,239
At first, he thinks,
"Just two bottles today."

312
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,534
"I'll just drink two bottles."
And he only buys two bottles.

313
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,370
Once he finishes them, he just wants more.

314
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,331
So he goes all the way
to the train station to buy more.

315
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,292
It would have been better
if he had started off with four bottles.

316
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:15,877
But it's always two.

317
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,755
That's how hard it is to be an alcoholic.

318
00:28:20,757 --> 00:28:22,092
You two must be close.

319
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:24,469
We're next-door neighbors.

320
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:27,514
Have you guys even talked?

321
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:30,892
Once.

322
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,688
So, while drinking,

323
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,357
he always goes in
and brings out a new glass.

324
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:41,778
He always has two or three
shot glasses on the table.

325
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:44,030
So I asked him why,

326
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,325
and he said he changes glasses
when he gets bored.

327
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,499
What a poor, lonely guy.

328
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,253
I thought he was really cool.

329
00:28:59,588 --> 00:29:00,463
Right.

330
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,632
See, during the day,

331
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,219
he drinks one glass
looking at the window on this side.

332
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:11,808
When the sun sets, he drinks one glass
looking at the porch over there.

333
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,394
At night,

334
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,231
he drinks one glass
looking at the other window.

335
00:29:19,816 --> 00:29:22,068
He only changes the direction

336
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,946
staying still like this.

337
00:29:27,115 --> 00:29:30,118
It's as if he's standing guard.
Like a neighborhood watch.

338
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,542
Hey, he's not out there today, though.

339
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,172
Come on. It's too hot and humid.

340
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,216
There's no breeze, either.
He's probably inside with the AC on.

341
00:29:48,762 --> 00:29:50,388
Let's call it a night.

342
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,390
Bring those with you.

343
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,019
Should I go over?

344
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:28,228
This wall is perfect
for catching mosquitoes.

345
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:30,731
You can see everything. It's so clean.

346
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:34,693
If a mosquito gets into my room,
I can never find it.

347
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,071
The wallpaper's a mess,
everything's a mess.

348
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:41,533
How many bottles have you had?

349
00:30:45,704 --> 00:30:48,874
I have the feeling that's the second.

350
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:55,130
I came because I thought it might
be more fun to have a drinking buddy

351
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,965
than change glasses.

352
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,013
Can I join you?

353
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,767
Where's a glass?

354
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:15,984
HANJO BANK

355
00:31:33,836 --> 00:31:35,629
Do I look pathetic to you, too?

356
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:40,676
No way.

357
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,260
YSTAT RESEARCH

358
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,348
Everything else is almost done,

359
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:11,850
but we don't have enough
single men in their 40s from Gangwon-do.

360
00:33:12,434 --> 00:33:15,062
We won't make it up
with cold calling by 6 p.m.

361
00:33:15,145 --> 00:33:16,355
We should widen the limit.

362
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,358
Let's try for a bit longer.
There's still time.

363
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:23,278
But it's a long shot. We haven't
gotten anyone in the past two hours.

364
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,199
Let's just widen the limit.

365
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:29,993
Then…

366
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:32,120
how about until eight?

367
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,206
Let's try until eight o'clock.

368
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:51,515
Working overtime again today?

369
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,809
He's making us every day.

370
00:33:54,851 --> 00:33:57,729
That's why he gives out
those lottery tickets so often.

371
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,068
By the way, how did your blind date go?

372
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:07,197
You know…

373
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:09,700
We agreed to meet again next time.

374
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,371
Doesn't "next time" usually mean "never"?

375
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,794
I was wondering,

376
00:34:21,628 --> 00:34:23,255
did you get your chompers done?

377
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,758
It's just that they look so straight.

378
00:34:29,803 --> 00:34:32,723
Don't you usually use
the word "chompers" with animals?

379
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:37,352
For people, we say "teeth."

380
00:34:48,238 --> 00:34:49,990
You can use the word chompers
on people too.

381
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:54,703
You can say chompers, teeth,
or gnashers. Right?

382
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,372
We can use any of them. What's with her?

383
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:18,894
Hey. Are you on your way home?

384
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:20,687
Yes.

385
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:23,106
Good job today.

386
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,816
You too, Mr. Park.

387
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:42,626
Can I ask you a question?

388
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:43,960
Sure.

389
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:52,636
How many of those lottery tickets
have you given out to women?

390
00:35:54,805 --> 00:35:56,014
I'm sure it's quite a lot.

391
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,016
And not just to women.

392
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:03,397
Do you know
you've never once given one to me?

393
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,740
No way.

394
00:36:13,824 --> 00:36:15,742
Not even once.

395
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:20,455
Hold on, wait.

396
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:22,207
Well…

397
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,085
I'm sorry, that shocked me quite a bit.

398
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,505
I should have been more subtle.

399
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:31,425
I'm embarrassed.

400
00:36:32,592 --> 00:36:34,636
-I'm so sorry.
-No.

401
00:36:48,984 --> 00:36:49,943
You know,

402
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:53,530
I've decided to love someone this winter.
Just anyone.

403
00:36:55,157 --> 00:36:56,950
Don't be nervous.

404
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:04,166
I've been so impatient lately,
I just want to die already.

405
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,710
After 14 years, my job is the same,

406
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:09,087
the meetings are the same,
and the people are the same,

407
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:12,841
I curse and get mad the same way.
It's all the same endless repetition.

408
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,302
"Will it be this way until I die?"

409
00:37:15,802 --> 00:37:18,430
"Let's not live like this anymore.
Let's just love anyone."

410
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:21,516
"Even a relationship
I force myself into could turn into love."

411
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,978
"I'll love him passionately.
I'll make him my whole world."

412
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,064
But…

413
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:30,108
no one comes near me.

414
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,861
Everyone skips over me, like you.

415
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:35,822
Well, that was…

416
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:38,158
A subconscious decision?

417
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,745
I want to know
why it was that you did that.

418
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,331
Why does everybody skip over me?

419
00:37:44,915 --> 00:37:47,959
I'm willing to hear
whatever you have to say

420
00:37:48,043 --> 00:37:50,795
even if it shatters my pride.

421
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,464
Why do you think that is?

422
00:37:54,299 --> 00:37:55,425
Well…

423
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:59,804
First of all, from my perspective,

424
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,308
the type of woman
a man likes never changes.

425
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:07,896
Whenever my friends introduce me
to their new girlfriends,

426
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:10,440
I find that they date people
who are just like their exes.

427
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:12,234
Men's tastes don't change.

428
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:18,281
In general, comedians marry comedians,
and actors marry actors, right?

429
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,785
-Well, that's who they see the most.
-No.

430
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,370
That's not the reason.

431
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:25,580
It's because
they're attracted to those types.

432
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:29,543
It's whether you prefer
someone who makes you laugh

433
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:32,003
or someone who makes your heart flutter.

434
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:33,588
I prefer the latter.

435
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:35,632
I prefer the latter too.

436
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:45,725
People who have a lot of dating experience
know what they want.

437
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,352
But those who don't,

438
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:50,814
don't know what they want
or what type of person they are.

439
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:54,401
They just want passionate romance
because that's what they hear people want.

440
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:56,194
But when they finally have it,

441
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:59,364
many find it
too embarrassing and can't stand it.

442
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,825
It can be embarrassing, but I like it.

443
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:05,870
When you're embarrassed about something,
it means you find it uncomfortable.

444
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:08,373
So…

445
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:15,255
You might be very natural and charming
in a different genre, Ms. Yeom.

446
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:18,049
Melodrama isn't the only genre
of relationships, right?

447
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,052
There's comedy, surrealism,

448
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,763
thriller… Yes, that's a good one.

449
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,850
What else, slice-of-life? Suspense?
There are so many.

450
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:32,480
In which genre among those
do you think you'd be most effective?

451
00:39:40,322 --> 00:39:41,781
What are your strengths?

452
00:39:48,788 --> 00:39:50,999
I'm like a Jindo dog.

453
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:54,961
I stand by my man and never betray him.
I protect him.

454
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,255
And my man must be a real man.

455
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:59,716
But I don't mean
he has to be all big and burly.

456
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:04,054
Yes, I have my own idea of masculinity.

457
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,138
A man, yes.

458
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:07,265
Slice-of-life it is. Yes.

459
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:09,726
It almost veered toward thriller,

460
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:11,478
but you're the slice-of-life type.

461
00:40:11,561 --> 00:40:14,856
Many are not really interested
in surprise events or grand gestures.

462
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:17,817
The most important thing to them
is their attitude toward life.

463
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,277
They look at a person's core.

464
00:40:21,863 --> 00:40:22,864
The core.

465
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:24,658
Attitude.

466
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:29,287
Anyway, if you keep that in mind,
you'll usually make the right choice.

467
00:40:30,413 --> 00:40:34,709
And rather than being recklessly
determined to love just anyone,

468
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:39,464
deciding to go for it
when you meet someone you like

469
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:40,924
will be far more constructive.

470
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:49,933
You really are an expert.

471
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:51,559
Okay.

472
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,064
If I meet a man I like,
I'm going to try to make the first move.

473
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:57,857
Not just the first move,

474
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,567
but the first confession.

475
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:04,447
That's so embarrassing though.

476
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:05,907
My mom always says,

477
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:09,577
"A house and spouse will come
to you when the time is right."

478
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,122
You'll find one when the time is right.

479
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:14,457
-Will he?
-He will.

480
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:17,502
Okay.

481
00:41:19,587 --> 00:41:23,091
I feel like I need to give you
a fortune-teller's fee or something.

482
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,175
No.

483
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:39,691
If I go this way, I can get home faster.

484
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,484
Get home safe.

485
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:44,738
You must really not be
interested in me at all.

486
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,573
You can't wait to go home.

487
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,285
No, I'm just kidding.

488
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:52,620
-Let's go together.
-No, go ahead.

489
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:54,497
-It's fine. Go ahead.
-All right.

490
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:58,084
-See you tomorrow.
-Go on, off you go. Go ahead. Go.

491
00:41:58,835 --> 00:41:59,753
See you tomorrow.

492
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:33,953
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

493
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,624
Something good, my foot.

494
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,117
I'm going to go.

495
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:16,788
Hey, use the restroom before you go.

496
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:19,290
I'm fine.

497
00:43:19,874 --> 00:43:22,126
Do as I say.
It's a long way back to Seoul.

498
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,170
I just wanted to try coming here once.

499
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,175
I came here for a change!

500
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:31,594
To your neighborhood, Dangmi Station!

501
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:34,597
It's nothing special.

502
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,285
Even if you need to pee, hold it.
This is the last train.

503
00:43:55,368 --> 00:43:57,412
Hold it until you get to Seoul.

504
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,003
I'm home.

505
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:48,671
Mom and Dad aren't here.

506
00:44:49,172 --> 00:44:50,340
Where are they?

507
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,507
At a funeral.

508
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:53,593
Who passed away?

509
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:54,969
Mom's uncle.

510
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,818
Why are you acting like you got dumped
when it was you who dumped her?

511
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,821
What do you mean?

512
00:45:15,323 --> 00:45:17,367
Lee Ye-rin. You're the one who dumped her.

513
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:22,288
Watching the movie
and going to the restaurant alone

514
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,165
when you promised to go together.

515
00:45:24,707 --> 00:45:27,168
Who wouldn't break up after that?

516
00:45:31,798 --> 00:45:34,258
He always does something
that'll get him dumped.

517
00:45:34,342 --> 00:45:36,344
He totally deserves it.

518
00:45:36,427 --> 00:45:37,887
Do you have another girl?

519
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,557
Did you want to break up with her
because you met someone else you liked?

520
00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:46,646
-Do you think I'd do that?
-Then why did you do it?

521
00:45:47,313 --> 00:45:50,274
Lee Ye-rin went home after crying
for a while at Dangmi Station.

522
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,155
I guess she knows she messed up.

523
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,074
You're the one who messed up.

524
00:45:58,157 --> 00:46:00,034
She started it!

525
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:01,828
I saw that look in her eyes.

526
00:46:01,911 --> 00:46:05,206
The look in her eyes that says,
"This guy's nothing special."

527
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:08,000
The look I've seen
in their eyes many times.

528
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:11,379
"This guy's nothing special.
How shall I break up with him?"

529
00:46:11,462 --> 00:46:13,256
"What excuse should I come up with?"

530
00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:16,342
At first, I do as they say and play along.

531
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:18,636
"Yes, I know I'm nothing special."

532
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,056
"But I'm fun to be around.
At least I'm not a bore."

533
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:25,184
But if that doesn't work,
what am I supposed to do?

534
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:26,853
What else can I do
when they want to end it?

535
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:29,188
From that point on,
I start fighting them constantly.

536
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:32,024
And that's when the reason we broke up
becomes that I watched a movie alone,

537
00:46:32,108 --> 00:46:34,152
or that she texted some guy late at night.

538
00:46:34,235 --> 00:46:39,157
And it can never be because
she found out what a pathetic loser I am.

539
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:52,420
I know it, too.

540
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,966
That I'm not the best she can have.

541
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:04,390
I know that she thinks she can
find someone better.

542
00:47:11,022 --> 00:47:14,192
<i>He always asked, "Aren't you
curious about my neighborhood?"</i>

543
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:17,904
<i>"Aren't you curious about Dangmi Station?</i>

544
00:47:19,655 --> 00:47:21,157
<i>Tell him I know now.</i>

545
00:47:23,034 --> 00:47:23,910
DANGMI

546
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:26,579
<i>Now every time I pass near here,</i>

547
00:47:27,413 --> 00:47:29,290
<i>I'm sure I'll think of Yeom Chang-hee.</i>

548
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,501
YEOM CHANG-HEE

549
00:47:33,377 --> 00:47:34,879
YEOM CHANG-HEE

550
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,159
Where are you going this late?

551
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:26,889
I'm sorry

552
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:28,891
for the other day.

553
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:32,019
I was drunk and crossed the line.

554
00:48:34,355 --> 00:48:36,899
I'm not that rude usually.

555
00:48:41,362 --> 00:48:44,657
We should drink together sometime
and get to know each other.

556
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,832
What should I call you?
I only know your last name.

557
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:58,921
I was born in 1985…

558
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:07,972
I'll just call you Gu.

559
00:50:11,035 --> 00:50:13,245
Did everyone just arrive?

560
00:50:13,788 --> 00:50:15,539
I worked overtime. I didn't drink.

561
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,962
You're home.

562
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,577
<i>If you think about it,</i>

563
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:46,622
<i>all the assholes in my life</i>

564
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,333
<i>started with that same look in their eyes.</i>

565
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,628
<i>Eyes that seemed to say,</i>

566
00:50:53,378 --> 00:50:55,255
<i>"You're not good enough."</i>

567
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:02,137
<i>It makes you feel so small.</i>

568
00:51:03,013 --> 00:51:05,182
<i>Like you're insignificant.</i>

569
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:11,271
<i>It was that look
that made us sick and exhausted.</i>

570
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,568
<i>Repetitive relationships you jump into
to find something to love about yourself,</i>

571
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:21,323
<i>only to come out of them even more sure
of how unattractive you truly are.</i>

572
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:26,662
<i>Where should we look for the answer?</i>

573
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,500
What about you?
Have you ever made anyone feel whole?

574
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,465
SANPO KITCHEN SINK, CLOSET
CUSTOM-DESIGNED FURNITURE

575
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:21,550
It's too hot.

576
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:23,051
I want to eat something cold.

577
00:52:25,512 --> 00:52:26,346
Hey.

578
00:52:28,515 --> 00:52:31,310
Does that guy still eat
at your house these days?

579
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:35,814
Are you still uncomfortable around him?

580
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:39,735
Stop already. Forget what I said.

581
00:52:41,737 --> 00:52:43,697
-Hey, the omelet's pretty good.
-Really?

582
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,407
-Today's my lucky day.
-Is it?

583
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:54,833
<i>I'd like to discuss the details
of a new club with you.</i>

584
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:58,045
<i>So could you come
by the Center sometime today?</i>

585
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,362
These guys are seriously pissing me off.

586
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:41,213
Should we just report it
to the commission?

587
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:51,765
Are you going to go?

588
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:57,854
Let's just make one ourselves. Anything.

589
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:04,736
It seems they're going to
keep calling us until we join a club.

590
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:08,323
We can just tell them we'll form one,

591
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:10,450
and not do anything.

592
00:54:12,703 --> 00:54:14,746
But they'll probably be suspicious.

593
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,005
What if they ask what we're doing?

594
00:54:24,881 --> 00:54:25,799
A book club?

595
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:27,718
There's already a book club.

596
00:54:29,094 --> 00:54:30,387
What don't they have yet?

597
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:35,767
Hiking's probably taken.

598
00:54:36,393 --> 00:54:37,602
Definitely.

599
00:54:41,773 --> 00:54:43,734
We have to choose carefully.

600
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,154
If it's something they already have,
they'll make us join that.

601
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:48,655
Calligraphy?

602
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,036
Can't we get a list
of all the workplace clubs?

603
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,412
If we can, it'll be easy.

604
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:58,206
I think it's on the website.

605
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:00,959
Here, there's a list.

606
00:55:01,043 --> 00:55:02,127
Right, let's see.

607
00:55:04,463 --> 00:55:07,341
How about we actually do it?

608
00:55:12,429 --> 00:55:13,597
"The Liberation Club."

609
00:55:19,394 --> 00:55:20,479
I…

610
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,565
want liberation.

611
00:55:24,941 --> 00:55:26,401
I want to be liberated.

612
00:55:27,986 --> 00:55:32,074
I don't know where I'm trapped,
but I feel trapped.

613
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:35,035
There's nothing in my life
that relaxes me.

614
00:55:36,328 --> 00:55:38,413
I feel cramped and stifled.

615
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:43,335
I want to break free.

616
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:48,465
Liberation?

617
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:52,469
I like it.

618
00:56:04,147 --> 00:56:05,565
The three of you?

619
00:56:07,025 --> 00:56:07,901
Yes.

620
00:56:10,904 --> 00:56:14,282
What does "liberation" entail?

621
00:56:15,242 --> 00:56:17,869
The Republic of Korea
was liberated in 1945,

622
00:56:18,662 --> 00:56:20,664
but we have yet to find liberation.

623
00:56:21,957 --> 00:56:22,916
What?

624
00:56:25,043 --> 00:56:26,211
What?

625
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,423
That's it?

626
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:36,012
Well, so…

627
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:39,975
what are the three of you going to do?

628
00:56:41,184 --> 00:56:42,102
Liberation.

629
00:56:43,186 --> 00:56:44,354
That's what we'll do.

630
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:51,027
JOY SUPPORT CENTER

631
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:03,957
My gosh.

632
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:18,722
What are we actually
trying to liberate ourselves from?

633
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:20,891
What do we have to do?

634
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:33,069
Then let's first think about what we're
trying to liberate ourselves from.

635
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:13,652
Oh, my.

636
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:19,908
Cover it up.

637
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:49,646
Do you

638
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:52,315
want me to worship you?

639
00:58:58,154 --> 00:59:00,115
It seems you've never felt whole too.

640
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:05,829
Let me know if you want me to.

641

I'm heading out.

642
01:00:05,263 --> 01:00:07,057
Let's at least say hi from now on.

643
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,398
Let's at least say hi from now on.

644
01:00:26,993 --> 01:00:28,745
The bus is coming. You better run.

645
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:36,252
I said, run.
