5
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,855
-I'm home.
-Hey. Did you eat?

6
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,106
I did.

7
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:55,736
I'm home.

8
00:00:55,819 --> 00:00:58,322
You girls came home together? Did you eat?

9
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:00,074
I ate.

10
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:06,747
Fold your own clothes, okay?

11
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,708
I can't do any more of this. Gosh.

12
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:11,961
Goodness.

13
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,297
She must be out of her mind.

14
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:35,002
Good morning.

15
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:41,050
We're giving out free glasses
to the customers who buy soju.

16
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,301
Should I get you a set?

17
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:46,638
They're pretty nice.
It's a set of four, and they're pretty.

18
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,642
I'll get you one.

SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

31
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,468
Tell the store owners
to keep this special term a secret.

32
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,469
Got it.

33
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:34,056
They know we give rental assistance
to the stores with high sales,

34
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,808
but they'll get jealous
if they see it happen around them.

35
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:37,809
I know.

36
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:39,895
Have him sign it by this week if you can

37
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,855
before other chains make better offers.

38
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:45,609
He may not sign it,
but he won't switch over to a competitor.

39
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:50,864
Five years?

40
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:56,578
Hey. I'll be 83 in five years.

41
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,290
Who knows if I'll still be around then?

42
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,709
Come on, everybody lives
to be over 80 these days.

43
00:06:02,793 --> 00:06:04,253
Not everyone.

44
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:08,590
Look. I got this pair of shoes
for 160,000 won,

45
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,177
but they tried to sell me
two pairs for 240,000 won.

46
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,639
Who are they kidding?
One pair will be enough until I die.

47
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,184
I buy only one pair of underwear
at a time too.

48
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:22,479
They'll all go to waste when I die,
so why stock up?

49
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:27,234
I mean, it wouldn't be surprising
even if I died today.

50
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,319
Five years?

51
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:30,988
Jeez.

52
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:34,324
When I die,

53
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:39,955
one of my kids will have to
come and clean this place up.

54
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:42,749
The thought of it keeps me up at night.

55
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,378
"Just two more years to go."

56
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,672
"Just one more, and I'm done."

57
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:52,384
That's how I completed my contract.
But you bring me a new one?

58
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:58,307
Should I bring you
a ten-year contract then?

59
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:02,686
Keep telling yourself, "Just one more
year," and you'll live ten more years.

60
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,897
And when it ends,
sign another ten-year contract.

61
00:07:05,981 --> 00:07:07,107
You might as well curse at me.

62
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:11,653
Then are you going to give up the store
that makes you ten million per month?

63
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:14,281
Like you said, you don't know
when you're going to go.

64
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,369
I've made enough money.

65
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,706
More than enough.

66
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:26,251
I should pack it in
while I can do it myself.

67
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,339
I'm done.

68
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,133
See if anyone wants to take over.

69
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,849
Why don't you do it?

70
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:55,280
DAD

71
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,164

72
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,499
CALLING
DAD

73
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:17,969
Shoot, hang on.

74
00:08:19,054 --> 00:08:20,430
Damn it.

75
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,316
We can manage the store directly,
so make sure the word doesn't get out.

76
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,442
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,569
All right, bye.

78
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:40,951
It's 300 million for the deposit
and the premium?

79
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,244
That's a really good deal.

80
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,413
They earn five million won daily.

81
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:46,790
And the monthly net profit
is eight to ten million.

82
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,584
Just talk to your dad about it.

83
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,753
He'll have to sell his land
to come up with 300 million.

84
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,965
Do you really think he'd do that
to run a convenience store?

85
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:58,343
I already asked him once when the store
in Yeoksam-dong became available.

86
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:01,138
He called me an ingrate
who wants to sell our family land.

87
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:04,808
How else would we make 10 million a month
with a 300-million investment?

88
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:09,146
He never listens.
He won't believe me or listen to me.

89
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,856
Even if it rained money

90
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,567
and everyone in the country
started picking them up,

91
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,652
I'm sure he'd just be
working at his warehouse.

92
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:21,658
I mean, I respect that.
What else can I do?

93
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,706
What about you?
You should take over if you can.

94
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,375
You think I have 300 million?

95
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,210
Can't you take out a loan?

96
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,963
You think I have the assets
to borrow 300 million with?

97
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,134
What about your friend, Du-hwan?

98
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:42,804
All he has is his house.
I can't ask him to sell it.

99
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,891
This is driving me crazy.

100
00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:48,018
Ten million per month
is right in front of me.

101
00:09:49,352 --> 00:09:53,064
How come everyone I love
doesn't have any money?

102
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:01,364
Don't you ever end up loving me. Got it?

103
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:41,112
Han Su-jin.

104

Park Sin-yeong.

107
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:52,582
Nice.

108
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,584
Good going.

109
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,420
You printed out your plane tickets
using the company printer?

110
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:07,597
Guam?

111
00:11:08,682 --> 00:11:10,392
Must be nice to go on a trip to Guam.

112
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,028
By the way,

113
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:25,407
why aren't you
going along with them, Mi-jeong?

114
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,315
-Hyeok!
-Yes, sir.

115
00:11:58,398 --> 00:11:59,524
What's for lunch today?

116
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,109
How about the usual?

117
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,654
Aren't you going for lunch?

118
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,494
What do we do?

119
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,207
I'm still not going to quit.

120
00:12:57,707 --> 00:13:01,586
The way people look at me
when I come in and out of this building.

121
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,381
That's enough for me.

122
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,550
I used to envy people who work here.

123
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,762
"I want to work at a place like that."

124
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,932
And I work at that place now.

125
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:15,183
That's enough for me.

126
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,104
No one knows what I go through in here.

127
00:13:19,688 --> 00:13:22,232
Who cares what my employee number
begins with?

128
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:26,194
I'm just relieved
I don't have to wear a different lanyard.

129
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:29,072
Other companies have temps
wear different colored lanyards,

130
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:30,949
so it's humiliating to be seen wearing.

131
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,660
Even the nearby store owners can tell

132
00:13:33,743 --> 00:13:35,704
whether you're a regular employee
or a temp.

133
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:40,750
They wouldn't have invited me
even if I was a regular employee.

134
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,379
Because I don't own a bikini.

135
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,906

137
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:16,953
<i>I feel better when I see this.</i>

138
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,553
I'll drive.

Damn it.

00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,053
Shoot. Let's take some out.

149
00:17:29,307 --> 00:17:31,726
Why were you keeping all these bottles?

150
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:34,479
You should've had us throw them out.

151
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:36,689
You're not collecting these, are you?

152
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:40,610
Just leave them.

It won't take long.

154
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,907
Why don't you take a shower?
We'll take them to the junk shop.

155
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,126
I said, leave them.

156
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,840
But it'll only take a minute.

157
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,719
If someone wanted to clean up your shit,
would you like that?

158
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,985
Shouldn't we put these back?

<i>It's just outside of Seoul.</i>

163
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:28,009
<i>I feel better when I see this.</i>

164
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:39,312
MR. GU

165
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,485
GI-JEONG

166
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,945
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

167
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,655
<i>I feel like we have to.</i>

168
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,754
Stop staring.

169
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,133
Hey.

170
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,094
I'm the one
who decided to love just anyone.

171
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,723
You literally picked just anyone.

172
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:20,603
Hanging out with Dumbo as a kid
made you develop terrible taste in men.

173
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,857
We live in a small town.
What are you going to do?

174
00:20:29,946 --> 00:20:31,364
What are you so afraid of?

175
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:37,161
You've been picky with men all your life.
Where has that gotten you?

176
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,956
You said our mistake was that

177
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,167
we passed on guys
without giving them a try as practice,

178
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,628
and that's why
nothing ever happened to us.

179
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:47,505
And?

180
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,840
I'm going to practice now.

181
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,427
What could you practice
with that alcoholic?

182
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,723
Don't say he's not an alcoholic.

183
00:20:58,266 --> 00:20:59,976
And don't say I drink more than him.

184
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,272
Gi-jeong.

185
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:05,648
You be quiet.

186
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,203
Hey.

187
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,540
Yes, a little.

188
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:24,959
Yes, go wait at my place then.

189
00:21:26,544 --> 00:21:28,462
It's going to be a while.

190
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,006
Yes.

191
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:32,675
There's some pizza in the freezer.

192
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,677
Yes.

193
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,681
Weren't you going to break up with him?

194
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,058
I did.

195
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:45,563
Come on, don't be so square.

196
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,316
Hey, don't hang out with her anymore.

197
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,234
You stay away from Mi-jeong from now on.

198
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,361
You've become like her.

199
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,957
When I was dating Chan-hyeok,

200
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,712
he said he'd quit his job
and start a business of his own.

201
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:12,214
That made me happy.

202
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,721
Because then I could tell people
that my boyfriend

203
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,307
ran his own business.

204
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,809
I thought it sounded cool.

205
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,313
But then,

206
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,524
when he became very successful,

207
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:32,902
it made me anxious.

208
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,113
We weren't even married yet.

209
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,329
Then hise business began dwindle
because he sold defective products.

210
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,542
So I tried to be nicer to him than ever.

211
00:22:52,755 --> 00:22:54,965
It felt like he knew I was relieved.

212
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:00,179
I was looking for someone

213
00:23:01,263 --> 00:23:03,140
who'd make me look like a better person.

214
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,227
A boyfriend who'd make me look better.

215
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:11,107
Even with all my picking and choosing,

216
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,527
I never fully supported him.

217
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,905
I wanted him
to be more successful than I was,

218
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:20,616
but not too much.

219
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:27,123
I've never given my everything
to someone or vice versa.

220
00:23:32,128 --> 00:23:33,963
I'll never do something like that again.

221
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:37,633
If my partner finds success
and I'm afraid of losing him,

222
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,552
I'll gladly let him go.

223
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,637
Even if he hits rock bottom,

224
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,181
I won't be embarrassed of him.

225
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,725
Even if everyone points the finger at him,

226
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:50,104
I'll treat him as I always did

227
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:52,857
and just support him.

228
00:23:58,028 --> 00:23:59,405
Even our own parents

229
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,283
never gave us that kind of support.

230
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,554
Why are you crying?

231
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,808
Hey.

232
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,189
Can I order chicken gizzards?

233
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,609
Go ahead.

234
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,778
One plate of chicken gizzards, please!

235
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,552
Listen, Dad.

236
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,681
I'm just telling you this

237
00:25:07,765 --> 00:25:11,435
because I think I'll regret it if I don't.

238
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,148
This is just a suggestion
so please hear me out.

239
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,697
There's a good store that's become
available. The deposit is 300 million.

240
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:26,659
The owner makes a net profit
of eight to ten million per month.

241
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:29,328
He's run the store for ten years

242
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,580
so he's earned at least a billion won.

243
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,709
If you want me to bring you
the sales records to prove it, I can.

244
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:39,088
Now, you might ask
why the owner is quitting then.

245
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,965
He's turning 80 soon.

246
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:43,801
He has two kids. One lives in the U.S.
and the other in Yeosu.

247
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:45,219
Neither can take over.

248
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,348
This is not for my sake.

249
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,851
If you think I want to quit my job
and make easy money with the store,

250
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:53,852
that's not it.

251
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:56,647
It's finders keepers. It's up for grabs.

252
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,983
Many people want this kind of information,

253
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,820
but he asked me first
because I'm the manager in charge.

254
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:07,575
If you're interested, this is
a great investment opportunity for you.

255
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:21,630
I can make a living just fine on my own.

256
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:23,757
If you want to do it,

257
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,386
come up with 300 million
and do it yourself. I won't stop you.

258
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,400
Okay.

259
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:05,132
I'll give you the money if you want.

260
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,220
If I divorce your dad,
I'll probably get 300 million at least.

261
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:13,265
I didn't mean that I wanted to do it.

262
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,559
Everyone else makes
their money grow this way.

263
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,857
Why is my family always like this?

264
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,908
Please enjoy.

265
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,576
-Thank you.
-It looks delicious.

266
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,286
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

267
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,206
-Hello.
-Oh, hey.

268
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,754
Where's Gyeong-seon?

269
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:44,797
She'll be late.

270
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:48,759
He found the remote
for the air conditioner.

271
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,845
-Wait, hold on.
-Thank you.

272
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:54,390
He should stop rummaging.
Who knows what he might find?

273
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:56,475
-What do you want? Beer?
-That's it.

274
00:27:57,935 --> 00:28:00,437
We'll have this and…

275
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,284
-Give me my beer.
-Let me.

276
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:20,958
You should've asked me for it.

277
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,627
I figured you'd be tired.

278
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:27,339
I only help out on busy days.
We don't get too many days like today.

279
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,133
Apologize!

280
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,135
They have fun like this. What's with them?

281
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:32,261
Look.

282
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,306
I didn't know people actually said that
in everyday life.

283
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,685
Is it just me,
or does that make you uncomfortable too?

284
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:42,104
It makes me uncomfortable too.

285
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,022
Right?

286
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:46,025
I mean, I had this thing
with a researcher at work.

287
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,693
She said, "Apologize."

288
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:51,280
My heart started pounding,
and I couldn't say anything.

289
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,282
Like, "what did I do that was so wrong?"

290
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:59,246
I think it's okay to say, "I'm offended,
and what you did was wrong."

291
00:29:00,456 --> 00:29:01,957
But when you say, "Apologize,"

292
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,585
it's like coming to a conclusion
without even arguing

293
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,838
that you're the victim,
and they're the offender.

294
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:08,964
Right? Exactly.

295
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,841
Jeez, you're right.

296
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,636
When I heard that, it felt like
I had been sentenced to death,

297
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,182
had fallen into a pit,
and had cement poured down on me.

298
00:29:18,265 --> 00:29:20,434
It felt like I was someone
who deserved that

299
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,311
so I couldn't sleep at all that night.

300
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:26,648
The worst part is
that I apologized to her the next day.

301
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,484
I didn't even know what I did wrong.

302
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,570
You're too nice.

303
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:35,699
That woman knows how much
those words throw people off.

304
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,369
Is asking for an apology
a new way of arguing with people?

305
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:40,829
Maybe it's like throwing the first punch.

306
00:29:42,164 --> 00:29:45,626
Apologizing used to be
such an awesome thing to do.

307
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,627
Right?

308
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,753
Yes.

309
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:51,465
It used to be an act of bravery

310
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:54,635
that took self-reflection
and was excruciatingly painful.

311
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:57,805
I don't know when it turned

312
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,516
into such a cowardly thing
that's forced upon you.

313
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:06,438
You never really see
those brave, touching apologies anymore.

314
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,400
It makes me quite sad.

315
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,908
By the way, I'd like to apologize.

316
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,079
For that day.

317
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,083
You did. You even gave me
ten lottery tickets.

318
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:30,337
No, I didn't do it properly.
I just glossed over it.

319
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,299
You said getting married was
the best thing you'd ever done.

320
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:37,761
And that if you hadn't, you would never
have had such a lovely daughter.

321
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,264
It's been weighing on my mind
for a long time.

322
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:42,724
I realized I was wrong.

323
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,102
It's such a valuable relationship to you.

324
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:48,730
I shouldn't have mocked it like that.
I'm sorry.

325
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,816
Don't be. It's all right.

326
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:52,359
No, I'm really sorry.

327
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:53,777
It's really okay.

328
00:30:54,403 --> 00:30:58,240
I think I should apologize
to your daughter as well.

329
00:30:58,323 --> 00:30:59,950
Gosh, please don't.

330
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:02,744
It'd be better not to.

331
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,873
Are you trying to heat up the beer?

332
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:08,792
Jeez, what is she doing,
hugging them like that?

333
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:12,045
Three draft beers, please.

334
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,589
Coming right up.

335
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,174
Okay then.

336
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:30,856
You can only date someone
who scores a hundred points

337
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:33,400
only when you can date
someone who's a zero.

338
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:36,403
You always look for someone on your level.

339
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:40,782
Maybe 64,238? Somewhere around that.

340
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,744
Honestly, I score 78 at the least.

341
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,913
That's what you think.

342
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:47,497
No, I really would.

343
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:50,626
Just forget about the grading system.

344
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,545
My point is, don't limit yourself.

345
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,714
You have the whole world
trying to limit you.

346
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:58,717
So why would you want
to do that to yourself?

347
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:01,553
You're so cute.

348
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:05,766
You're so adorable.

349
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,977
I'm just trying to help you.

350
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,687
Don't drink by yourself.

351
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:17,402
<i>I'll be home late tonight.</i>

352
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:19,279
<i>I'm having a drink with my sister.</i>

353
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,747
<i>I can't help but wait
for you to text me back.</i>

354
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,626
<i>But I won't let get to me</i>

355
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:35,128
<i>and do the same to get even with you.</i>

356
00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:39,883
<i>I've always tried to silently
get even with my ex-boyfriends.</i>

357
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:42,386
<i>I'm done with it.</i>

358
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:56,900
<i>I love that
I don't have to measure your affection.</i>

359
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,028
<i>All I need to do is worship you.</i>

360
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:02,906
<i>I love it.</i>

361
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:45,824
AVAILABLE

362
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:20,901
Hello.

363
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,878
God. I ran into Mr. Gu on my way here,
and it was so awkward.

364
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,924
I even rehearsed
what I'd do if I ran into him.

365
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:46,635
But I never thought
he'd suddenly show up in front of me.

366
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,678
He totally caught me off guard.

367
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:54,226
He was getting closer, and I didn't know
if I should turn my head or not.

368
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,729
Then I missed the right timing
and greeted him so awkwardly.

369
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:03,944
Well, Chang-hee told me to come over
to his house yesterday,

370
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:05,821
I was so shocked.

371
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:09,282
There was a dazzling light
coming from his room.

372
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,910
I thought there was an alien in there.

373
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,996
His room was full of empty soju bottles.

374
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:19,042
It was so hot in there too,
with the sun beating down on it.

375
00:35:19,126 --> 00:35:22,212
So we tried to clean it up,
but he got mad at us for it.

376
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:25,507
Well, he didn't really flip out,
but anyway…

377
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,010
Jeez, he got angry at us
for trying to clean his room.

378
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,720
It was so embarrassing.

379
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:34,683
Did he ask for your help?

380
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,191
Did he ask you to throw them out?

381
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,822
If not, why would you do that?

382
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,574
Then what? I couldn't ignore it.

383
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,541
It's arrogant how you're
trying to change him.

384
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:03,170
Wait, arrogant?

385
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:04,463
You got it all wrong.

386
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:06,923
It was an amount
he couldn't throw out by himself.

387
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:09,593
That's also the amount of alcohol
he had by himself.

388
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:10,802
And he got caught.

389
00:36:10,886 --> 00:36:13,763
"Got caught?"
It's not like we didn't know about it.

390
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:19,644
All the neighbors know.

391
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:26,860
Move over.

392
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:40,165
SANPO SINKS

393
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,792
-You got it?
-Yes.

394
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,141
Wait and see.
I'm going to get rid of them later.

395
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:00,769
Hurry up. Let's get it done
while he's out.

396
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,312
Don't.

397
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,330
Boy, she must've drunk a lot last night.

398
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,309
Hello, sir.

399
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:43,395
Yes.

400
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,815
What? When?

401
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:53,029
But…

402
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:54,197
Right.

403
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:26,062
I got a call from the store owner.

404
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:29,274
Someone has already signed
a lease contract with the landlord.

405
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,234
I think the landlord listed it for lease

406
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:33,278
when he heard
the store owner was quitting.

407
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:35,822
<i>Why would he do that
without even discussing it?</i>

408
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,576
Find out who signed the lease
and for what kind of business.

409
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,120
<i>We can't lose that spot.</i>

410
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,079
Yes, sir.

411
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,707
All right.

412
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:52,756
SANPO SINKS

413
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,853
I should've kept my distance.

414
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:09,022
I let them in too much.

415
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,909
Sometimes I'm okay with it.

416
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:26,164
But other times…

417
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,086
I hate the sight of people
moving around in front of me.

418
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,966
I hate it more when they start talking.

419
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,764
I have to listen to their gibberish
and have to say gibberish back to them.

420
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:46,643
What should I say?

421
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:50,689
It's taxing to think of what to say next.

422
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:55,652
I feel the same way.

423
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:03,034
Out of the 24 hours in a day,
I only feel okay

424
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:05,412
for about a couple.

425
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:09,165
And it's not like I even feel good,
I just feel okay.

426
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,962
I just try to get through the rest.

427
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,094
It's been like that since I was little.

428
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:24,180
When I looked at the kids
running around happily,

429
00:40:24,264 --> 00:40:26,766
I was upset even at that young age.

430
00:40:27,767 --> 00:40:29,644
"What are they so happy about?"

431
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,981
"Why am I not happy like them?"

432
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:37,360
"I eat and sleep. Eat and sleep."

433
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:41,489
"Why do I have
to waste such a long amount of time?"

434
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:47,245
I'd be perfectly okay if I only
got to live 8 years instead of 80.

435
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:53,376
I don't do anything
but I'm already exhausted.

436
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:02,552
Still, I drag myself along,

437
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:06,431
like driven cattle.

438
00:41:08,183 --> 00:41:09,559
"Let's keep going."

439
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:14,689
"I don't know why I have to live,

440
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:18,485
but let's have a decent life
while I'm alive."

441
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:24,282
That's how I barely manage to drag myself

442
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:26,701
every day.

443
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:32,248
A cattle drive?

444
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:33,958
A cattle drive…

445
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,962
You must have seen it before.

446
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:40,507
A few times as a kid.

447
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,406
Ice cream?

448
00:42:07,283 --> 00:42:08,368
I bought it

449
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,620
because I was drunk.

450
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,212
When I'm drunk,

451
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:22,340
I'm more human than I am when I'm sober.

452
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,141
I like that.

453
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:28,656
I didn't put it up for lease.

454
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,825
The real estate agency called me first

455
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,411
to ask if the store owner
was closing down his store.

456
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:36,414
I didn't know what they were
talking about, so I asked him,

457
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,125
and he said he really was quitting.

458
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,919
But I didn't tell the agency.

459
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:43,880
Why would I do that
when I'm not the landlord?

460
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,506
It wasn't me either.

461
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,678
But they said someone who knew about it
came to rent this place.

462
00:43:51,346 --> 00:43:53,806
Do you know what kind of business
they want to do here?

463
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,142
A convenience store.

464
00:43:58,186 --> 00:43:59,812
Do you know which chain?

465
00:43:59,896 --> 00:44:01,981
This chain. The same one.

466
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,612
Apparently, their daughter
works at the head office for this company.

467
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,238
She used to manage this store.

468
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:11,991
Gosh.

469
00:44:16,037 --> 00:44:17,872
She came here a couple of days ago.

470
00:44:18,498 --> 00:44:19,582
Damn it.

471
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:27,882
You could've told me at least.

472
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:35,431
I didn't know my dad would go
and sign the lease right away.

473
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:39,102
I just stopped by the store
to say hi to the owner,

474
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:41,521
and he told me he was going to quit.

475
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,939
All I told my dad was

476
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:47,193
I don't get why he's quitting
when the store is doing so well.

477
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:50,029
I really didn't know
he'd rent the place right away.

478
00:44:50,113 --> 00:44:51,239
You didn't know?

479
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,783
Do you expect me to believe that?

480
00:44:54,283 --> 00:44:56,119
His daughter works at the head office.

481
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:59,330
What kind of father signs the lease
without checking with her first?

482
00:45:00,081 --> 00:45:02,542
He even knew
to contact the real estate agency first.

483
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,921
Do you want me to call my dad and ask?
Should we all meet and talk?

484
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:09,549
Forget it.

485
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,218
Let's think of it as a good thing.

486
00:45:13,302 --> 00:45:16,222
It's better than losing the spot
to another chain, right?

487
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:22,311
You're making me look really bad here.

488
00:45:22,395 --> 00:45:25,189
Like I pulled
some dirty trick or something.

489
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,441
Darn it.

490
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,825

497

<i>Why isn't my dad like A-reum's dad?</i>

498
00:45:54,677 --> 00:45:55,636
I was the one

499
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:58,890
who insisted on giving that store
rental assistance.

500
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:00,683
And in the end,

501
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:04,061
I ended up making the rent
cheaper for A-reum.

502
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,775
It always turns out this way.

503
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:12,737
The person I hate the most
takes everything.

504
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,198
From now on,

505
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:19,702
I'm going to put my life on the line
and love A-reum.

506
00:46:20,703 --> 00:46:23,915
I'm going to love her
more than anyone in the world

507
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,375
and make her go completely bust.

508
00:46:27,293 --> 00:46:28,377
Just you wait.

509
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:32,340
Soon enough,
you'll see the power of my love.

510

517
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:14,841
Excuse me.

518
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:23,266
Normally, I'm ready to
pass out around ten.

519
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:26,764
But it was two in the morning,
and I was totally fine.

520
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,975
I mean, I felt like
I could drink all night.

521
00:47:29,058 --> 00:47:32,019
I almost winked at him like this.

522
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:36,148
I like him so much.
God, I almost winked at him.

523
00:47:36,238 --> 00:47:38,985
No winking.

524
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:42,655
No one in the world winks anymore.
It's gone extinct.

525
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,198
What era do you live in?

526
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:46,450
I know, right?

527
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:47,994
But I can't help myself.

528
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,621
There are no steps in-between.
I'm diving right in.

529
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:52,248
I shouldn't do this, right?

530
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:56,669
I'm skipping all the steps
and running towards the end.

531
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:59,005
-I just like him so much.
-This is so frustrating.

532
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:01,007
Wink at him, and it's all over for you.

533
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,051
-Well, I didn't wink at him.
-My God.

534
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:05,177
But you know…

535
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,028
You're here.

536
00:48:22,862 --> 00:48:24,071
What do you want to drink?

537
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,703
Apparently, A-reum has poached
three stores that way.

538
00:48:30,786 --> 00:48:32,538
Her family's like a corporation.

539
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,458
The daughter gathers intel
and the father calls the shots.

540
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,084
We work at the same company,

541
00:48:37,168 --> 00:48:39,170
but she has her own business
while I don't.

542
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,048
I should learn from her

543
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:43,966
but I don't want to.

544
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,177
Even if I did, my dad wouldn't.

545
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:49,263
Let me meet her.

546
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:52,892
Jeong A-reum? I'll make her
lose her ability to talk for a month.

547
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,937
She's doing that knowing that
people will put up with her.

548
00:48:57,021 --> 00:48:58,814
That's why she keeps doing that.

549
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:01,609
She should meet someone like me
who won't tolerate it.

550
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,071
My story isn't over yet.

551
00:49:06,072 --> 00:49:08,449
Fine. Let's hear what you have to say.

552
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:09,992
What did you want to brag about?

553
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:13,537
So I went to take some cash out,
all angry.

554
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,875
<i>It was like no one there knew
how to use an ATM.</i>

555
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,460
<i>They were all so slow.</i>

556
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:22,505
<i>Shouldn't you use the machine just once?</i>

557
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:24,673
<i>They should line up again
if they need another transaction.</i>

558
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,301
<i>But they took their time
with multiple bank books.</i>

559
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:30,304
<i>I thought, "This must be how it feels
to die of frustration."</i>

560
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:34,100
<i>I felt like I might lose it.</i>

561
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,768
<i>One bad thing had happened,</i>

562
00:49:35,851 --> 00:49:38,104
<i>and it felt as if
it was building up to something.</i>

563
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:59,708
<i>One day, my friend got drunk
and made a scene after a breakup.</i>

564
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,628
<i>Then he got into a fight at a bar
and was taken to the police.</i>

565
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:06,423
<i>And it turned out the other guy
was feeling miserable that day too.</i>

566
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:08,300
<i>Like attracts like. It's science.</i>

567
00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:11,637
<i>People who are similar
always get together and cause trouble.</i>

568
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,642
<i>I knew I had to be careful.</i>

569
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:18,185
<i>I might meet someone</i>

570
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:22,148
<i>who also wants to beat somebody to death
and get into serious trouble.</i>

571
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:23,482
<i>I had to be careful.</i>

572
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,944
<i>Then someone tapped on my shoulder.</i>

573
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:27,945
I'm sorry, but…

574
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:31,907
<i>He said his bus was arriving soon
and asked if he could go first.</i>

575
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,743
<i>I guess he was taking
an intercity bus or something.</i>

576
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,580
<i>I thought, "Here it comes."</i>

577
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:42,251
<i>I didn't think I could say anything nice.</i>

578
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:47,173
<i>Welcome.</i>

579
00:50:59,018 --> 00:51:00,352
That's it?

580
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:04,106
Good job.

581
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,358
Call Jeong A-reum here.

582
00:51:06,442 --> 00:51:07,610
Jeez.

583
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:09,695
We should go.

584
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,623
<i>He probably didn't want to miss his bus.
He left in a hurry.</i>

585
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:22,374
<i>So I could see his bank balance.</i>

586
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,627
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR
THE REQUESTED WITHDRAWAL OF 50,000 WON

587
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:28,839
<i>He couldn't withdraw 50,000 won
because he didn't enough money.</i>

588
00:51:33,469 --> 00:51:34,929
<i>I was glad I let him go first.</i>

589
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:36,764
It made me feel better.

590
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,892
But it's not because
I think I'm better off than he is.

591
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,268
That'd be rude.

592
00:51:41,894 --> 00:51:45,689
If you ask me if I'm the kind of jerk
who takes comfort in others' misfortune,

593
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:46,815
I am.

594
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,026
But I don't want to do that to that man.

595
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,654
He didn't even have 50,000 won.

596
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,365
If he missed his bus too,
it would have been the worst.

597
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,075
Because I gladly let him go first…

598
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,911
Well, maybe not gladly.

599
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:03,332
Anyway, because I let him go first,
he probably caught his bus.

600
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,792
You see,

601
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,837
it's amazing
how I always know when it's time.

602
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:10,798
Time to back off.

603
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:15,552
Even when I go crazy and out of control,
I still get a hold of myself.

604
00:52:15,636 --> 00:52:16,887
Things happen that way.

605
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,433
I think it's fate that I live like this.

606
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:23,686
I'm like a drizzle.

607
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:28,899
I may not have a big current of my own
like the river or the ocean,

608
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:33,821
but I'm like a drizzle
that soaks people without them realizing.

609
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:35,614
That's right.

610
00:52:35,698 --> 00:52:37,908
I think I'll be able to afford that.

611
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:41,203
Drizzle? That's nice.

612
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:43,914
But don't forget
about Jeong A-reum though.

613
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,834
You brought your resume, right?

614
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:48,127
-Yes.
-Okay.

615
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:54,883
Hello.

616
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,137
Oh, the girlfriend.

617
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,474
This promotion has already ended.

618
00:53:02,558 --> 00:53:05,060
I keep forgetting to take it down.

619
00:53:05,144 --> 00:53:08,689
You didn't need to bring a resume.
You're Yeom's girlfriend.

620
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:11,108
I can't vouch for her.
You have to be careful.

621
00:53:12,234 --> 00:53:14,028
RESUME
NAME: JI HYEON-A

622
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,780
"Ji Hyeon-a." What a pretty name.

623
00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:18,449
May I?

624
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:22,328
When can you start?

625
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,871
I can start immediately.

626
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,122
-Really?
-Yes.

627
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,498
That's perfect.

628
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,251
"5885"? That should be easy to remember.

629
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:31,420
Memorize it already. I memorized yours.

630
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:35,674
You didn't even memorize
your girlfriend's phone number?

631
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:44,308
I guess you two are okay
with things like that.

632
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,189
Welcome.

633
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:54,401
All right. Let me teach you this first.

634
00:53:56,487 --> 00:53:58,530
We can't take this many.

635
00:53:59,406 --> 00:54:02,785
We can only take 30 bottles
from each person per day.

636
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,328
This is just too many.

637
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,415
What are you going to do with all these?

638
00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:23,430
Here. Thank you.

639
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:35,234
Hello.

640
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:41,323
Here.

641
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,619
I sold the bottles.

642
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,293
This is for your friend.

643
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:58,173
Thank you.

644
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:12,771
He really sold them all.

645
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:27,661
<i>I wonder what the man living there
was doing at that time.</i>

646
00:55:38,213 --> 00:55:39,423
<i>Probably having a drink.</i>

647
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,191
<i>I'm as happy as when I get my paycheck
whenever you message me.</i>

648
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,114
Right.

649
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:06,325
The number for the courier
has changed, right?

650
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:07,868
What is it again?

651
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:12,539
Hang on.

652
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,171
-Here.
-Thank you.

653
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,342
Something smells nice. What is it?

654
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,259
What?

655
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,928
It's my hand cream.

656
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,514
This one.

657
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:33,977
It's lovely.

658
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,562
Right? I can get you one.

659
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:36,855
No, it's okay.

660
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,941
It's not expensive. I'll get you one.

661
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:40,526
Try it on.

662
00:56:43,529 --> 00:56:44,738
It smells nice.

663
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:46,532
Thanks.

664
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,657
<i>I cleaned my house for a change.</i>

665
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,909
<i>What do you think I’ll do
in my clean house now?</i>

666
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,542
<i>Drink.</i>

667
00:58:28,884 --> 00:58:29,760
Today…

668
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,972
I worked hard to drive myself,

669
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,850
like cattle on the range.

670
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,317
I locked myself in that room
and drank all winter.

671
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:48,737
When I tried to sleep,

672
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,533
there were bottles in the middle.

673
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,871
I could've just pushed them aside

674
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,167
but I couldn't even bother to do that.

675
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:08,048
So I curled up around them
like I was incubating an egg.

676
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,884
I could've just thrown them out.

677
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:19,726
But it felt as if I was walking out
of my own grave.

678
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,645
Completely hopeless.

679
00:59:24,189 --> 00:59:26,066
Looking at the soju bottles,

680
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,150
I thought…

681
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:30,696
"I guess this is it for me."

682
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,366
"There's no turning back now."

683
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,380
Today, I did something
I thought would take me forever to do.

684
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,299
I wonder if I can sleep tonight.

685
01:00:05,022 --> 01:00:06,815
I'm not going to ask you what happened.

686
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:09,443
I won't ask you where you're from.

687
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:11,987
Or why you moved here
and keep drinking the days away.

688
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,823
I don't care if you don't know
how to write Hangul

689
01:00:14,906 --> 01:00:16,450
or you don’t know your ABCs.

690
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:19,202
I won't tell you to stop drinking either.

691
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,455
And I'm not going to cling to you.

692
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,915
I'll be done once I feel whole.

693
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,296
That's cool.

694
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,057
I just worshiped you.

695
01:00:44,019 --> 01:00:47,189
Why don't you keep going?
I don't think that was enough.

696
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:10,587
How much if I jump over it?

697
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:12,464
Why would I pay you for that?

698
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:13,840
Because I'll do it.

699
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:14,925
Go ahead then.

700
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:16,635
Jeez, seriously.

701
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,975
Can you give me
some pointers before I jump?

702
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,436
Don't do it.

703
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:28,396
Why not?

704
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,733
You need to be able to run 100m
in under 11 seconds to make it.

705
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:33,777
You need the momentum.

706
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:37,572
How about 12 seconds flat?

707
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:42,035
As if you can actually do 12 seconds.

708
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:42,994
I can!

709
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,041
I'm sure I can make it.

710
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,085
I'll make it over easily.

711
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:54,256
Sure. You have to try to find out.

712
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,216
Don't you dare!

713
01:02:00,178 --> 01:02:01,471
How far are you going?

714
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:02,722
Are you going home?

715
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:15,819
I told you to stop!

716
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:31,751
5 MISSED CALLS

717
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:34,212
<i>Gu Ja-gyeong. Pick up your phone.</i>

718
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:36,173
<i>Where the hell are you hiding?</i>

719
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:40,302
<i>It's time for us to move. We have to go.</i>

720
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,387
<i>You don't have to hide anymore.</i>

721
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:51,021
He won't make it.

722
01:02:52,606 --> 01:02:53,732
Damn it!

723
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:07,996
I told you not to.

724
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:34,527

MY LIBERATION NOTES

726
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:47,619
<i>So, what does it feel like to date
someone who lives in the area?</i>

727
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:49,829
I like doing it.

728
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:54,417
<i>I feel peace
in my heart for the first time.</i>

729
01:03:54,501 --> 01:03:56,670
Yeom Gi-jeong? Nothing's happened so far.

730
01:03:56,753 --> 01:03:59,130
There's no way someone decent
is going to ask her out all of a sudden.

731
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:03,551
<i>What time is okay for you?
I couldn't wait for us to meet.</i>

732
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:05,220
<i>What about filing a lawsuit?</i>

733
01:04:05,303 --> 01:04:07,889
<i>-Please, just leave me be.</i>
-Are you still not over him?

734
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,808
Don't try to help me unless I ask you.

735
01:04:09,891 --> 01:04:12,310
<i>It feels like it's my fault
for getting myself in this situation.</i>

736
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:13,687
Where did you change your address to?

737
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,317
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>
