MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,480
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,255
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,338
It's such a shame about today, sir.

6
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:38,300
I swear I almost hit it.

7
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:43,471
Sir, why don't we go around
to check out the other side?

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,189
One of my managers got into some trouble
and has been arrested by the police.

9
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:56,651
For something personal.
It has nothing to do with the club.

10
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:58,153
But…

11
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:03,033
I think our chatrooms
have been exposed to the police.

12
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,702
So…

13
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:09,205
they must've figured out
how much we charge per table,

14
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,544
so we'll have to
declare our real income, sir.

15
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:17,881
Then…

16
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:20,884
we'll just have to raise the price.

17
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:23,970
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,181
-One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!
-One, two, three! Rock, paper, scissors!

19
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,974
-Yes!
-Yes.

20
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:10,934
-Hello?
-Damn it.

21
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:12,769
You can reserve a table now.

22
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:15,563
All right, I got it!

23
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,535
DAILY SALES REPORT

LEDGER

26
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:16,750
I'll make sure you have fun…

27
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,334
The hosts are coming in!

28
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:20,211
Go on in.

29
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:33,683
Well…

30
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,394
There are quite a few unpaid bills lately.

31
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,939
By the guests or by the managers?

32
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:41,900
Hey, man.

33
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:47,530
Bring me the ledger.

34
00:03:47,614 --> 00:03:49,199
Hey, send the managers in.

35
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,158
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,038
You gambled with the boys, didn't you?

37
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,289
Hey…

38
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:57,707
Are you serious?

39
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,502
I quit gambling ages ago.

40
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,670
I really didn't do it.

41
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,573
When did you become a manager?

42
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,535
Three months ago, sir.

43
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,537
And you have this many unpaid bills?

44
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,539
What's this? 1,2 million won?

45
00:04:39,123 --> 00:04:41,376
A customer changed her number
and ghosted us.

46
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:44,629
And the hosts don't know anything?

47
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:48,758
Even if we find them,
I doubt they have any money.

48
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,931
It's two women, who came in at times
with their salary.

49
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,768
{\an8}They always paid
with several credit cards.

50
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,812
{\an8}You put them on the tab

51
00:05:01,646 --> 00:05:04,607
{\an8}knowing they were going to ghost us?

52
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:09,612
{\an8}Chun-ja…

53
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,531
{\an8}Chun-ja!

54
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,166
{\an8}-Did you call me, sir?
-Call Ssaebi over.

55
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,589
{\an8}Ssaebi's gone to Busan today
to collect money, sir.

56
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:35,388
{\an8}You took a picture of their IDs, right?

57
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,433
{\an8}-Yes, sir.
-Follow me.

58
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,951
{\an8}-Damn it.
-Full house.

59
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:58,286
{\an8}Are they coming or not?

60
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,496
{\an8}-Pay up, come on.
-Just not my day.

61
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,414
{\an8}Thank you.

62
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,424
{\an8}Tell me everything you know about her.

63
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:20,850
{\an8}<i>Why does the boss</i>

64
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,977
{\an8}call you random names?

65
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,729
{\an8}Like "Chun-ja" or "Mal-ja."

66
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,275
{\an8}Well, I changed my name, you know.

67
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:33,279
And I don't think
he likes that name very much.

68
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:35,907
What's your new name?

69
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:38,242
Don't tell me…

70
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,080
"Bin"?

71
00:06:43,122 --> 00:06:45,124
It doesn't have "bin" in it, does it?

72
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,297
Damn it.

73
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,924
Watch it, you bastard.

74
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:53,967
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,053
-Here.
-Hey, you know her?

76
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,891
Oh, this girl?

77
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:04,936
She slips into a really strong dialect
when she's drunk.

78
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,729
The one that came with that big girl?

79
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:12,318
Girls who are afraid of others finding out
always come with the same friends.

80
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,277
That's right.

81
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,822
They didn't look that close,

82
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:17,782
but they always came together.

83
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,785
Didn't she say she works
at a dermatology clinic?

84
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:24,539
-A cosmetics store.
-Right. Cosmetics.

85
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:25,623
Where?

86
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,584
It was an old neighborhood.

87
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,046
Right. A department store
in Myeong-dong, sir.

88
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,923
She said she worked there.

89
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:54,652
<i>I'll show you how I became a manager
in just two weeks and the boss in a year.</i>

90
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:56,070
<i>Just watch.</i>

91
00:08:07,623 --> 00:08:08,791
There she is.

92
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,632
Can't you see her?
To your right, 1 o'clock.

93
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,063
You over there, who drank
at a host bar and ran off without paying!

94
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,407
You, I'm talking to you.

95
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,159
Hey.

96
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:52,001
Did you enjoy drinking
with those pretty men for free?

97
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:55,922
Look at me.

98
00:08:57,548 --> 00:08:58,674
I said, look at me.

99
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,345
Give my money back, you bitch!

100
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:13,147
<i>Please choose the service you require.</i>

Good night, sir.

00:12:01,983 --> 00:12:05,027
WE PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE

105
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,949
Are you hungry?

106
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:33,180
Your mom's here! Time to go home.

107
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:37,101
Where are your clothes?

108
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,859
You bastard! Are you serious?

109
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:47,278
How dare you bring our baby here?

110
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:49,030
Just leave with the baby.

111
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:50,239
You crazy bastard!

112
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,742
Let go! Let go of me, woman! Let go!

113
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:54,869
Come out, you bastard!

114
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:57,455
-What the hell's wrong with you, woman?
-What?

115
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:00,624
-Can't I drink in this kind of place?
-What makes you think you can?

116
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,090
Where did we put the jacket?

117
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,358
I'm the head of the household!

118
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,152
You don't even earn much!

119
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:30,071
What's wrong with you?

120
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,137
Here's your jacket. Let's get you home.

121
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,138
All right.

122
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,015
Oh, dear.

123
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:00,142
Oh, dear.

124
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,061
Come here. Good boy.

125
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,229
Oh, dear.

126
00:14:04,313 --> 00:14:05,898
"Bye-bye, mister."

127
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,458
You should have dinner, sir.

128
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,086
You haven't eaten anything today.

129
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,849
If you eat at 4 a.m.,

130
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:42,768
is it dinner or breakfast?

131
00:14:45,187 --> 00:14:48,065
I think it's dinner if you eat
before you go to bed,

132
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,734
and breakfast if you do after you wake up.

133
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,206
Did you eat yet?

134
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,670
The new cook's food is very good.

135
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:11,338
Why don't you try it?

136
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:28,772
Have you ever seen a baby?

137
00:15:35,488 --> 00:15:36,322
A baby.

138
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,242
A baby…

139
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,207
Not in a while.

140
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,377
Why do you ask?

141
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,964
This one time,

142
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:56,967
a baby came to the club.

143
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,849
Some asshole brought his kid.

144
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,109
It must have felt as if a bird flew in.

145
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:33,587
Dig in.

146
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:49,853
She said you seemed
to like sweet potato stems.

147
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:51,063
So she sent some.

148
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:21,260
Good morning, sir.

149
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:07,306
Mi-jeong!

150
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:10,851
Yeom Mi-jeong!

151
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,103
Did you call me, sir?

152
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:25,608
Mi-jeong.

153
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:27,485
Yes, sir.

154
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,988
What do you want to do?

155
00:18:31,864 --> 00:18:32,698
Sir?

156
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,328
I want to be in a really good mood,

157
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:39,955
but I have no idea what I should do.

158
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,333
So I'll let you do what you want to do.

159
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,126
What do you want?

160
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:52,343
Is there anything
you wish to happen today?

161
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:55,471
Is there anything like that?
Yeom Mi-jeong!

162
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,390
Go on, tell me.

163
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,310
I want to go home!

164
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,028
I want to go home

165
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,198
back to Naju, sir!

166
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:23,416
I'm going home!

167
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:06,167
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

168
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:42,912
I took a look at what you submitted
to apply for a permanent position.

169
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,707
But this Green Card booklet,

170
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,044
do you think it can be
included in your portfolio?

171
00:20:51,212 --> 00:20:53,714
You can't honestly say
you did it on your own.

172
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:57,760
You can't take credit for it.
Don't you think?

173
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:04,725
I attached it because I was asked
to submit everything I've worked on here.

174
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,187
And since I also attached
the new design plan,

175
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,815
I think it shows quite clearly

176
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,275
how much
my work contributed to the design.

177
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:24,161
Then tell me. How much
did your work contribute to the design?

178
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:28,165
<i>The least he could do is help.</i>

179
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:31,794
He's terrified you might become
a permanent employee. Bastard.

180
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:34,672
He's afraid
that you might win the contest.

181
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,091
I'm jealous of your permanent position,

182
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:39,426
but to think you'll have to
keep seeing him…

183
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,515
So what will you do?
You'll have to see him every day.

184
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,352
Who do you think will last longer here?

185
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,148
You've gotten cocky,

186
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:55,568
Ms. Design Contest Winner.

187
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,364
We don't know that yet.

188
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:03,576
I'm sure you'll win.

189
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,536
Have you heard?

190
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,623
Mr. Choi is having an affair.

191
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:12,501
-Really?
-With a girl who works here.

192
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,466
Gosh…

193
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,011
God, I feel so cold and lonely.

194
00:22:22,094 --> 00:22:24,179
Use the feelings you saved in summer.

195
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:27,016
Remember how we stored them up
when it was super hot?

196
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,059
Gosh, no.

197
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:30,811
I'll use them when it gets colder.

198
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,905
So-ra's grandma called earlier.

199
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:45,242
She wanted us to ask Mr. Gu
what she should do with the house.

200
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:51,081
He already paid rent for a year,

201
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:56,712
so she wants us to ask whether she should
leave it empty or if she can rent it out.

202
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:03,302
Why did he leave in such a hurry
without telling his landlady?

203
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,680
It seems he's changed his number.

204
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,849
But you're still in touch, right?

205
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:14,355
I don't know, either.

206
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,024
Why not?

207
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,776
Can't you reach him?

208
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:21,528
I don't try to.

209
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:07,908
<i>When I get frustrated,</i>

210
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,578
<i>I go out for a walk at night thinking,</i>

211
00:24:12,204 --> 00:24:14,289
<i>"I don't care if I die tonight."</i>

212
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>I walk through a pitch-dark mountain.</i>

213
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,931
<i>What's the big deal
about some guy leaving?</i>

214
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,560
<i>He ran because he was
afraid of being happy.</i>

215
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:32,618
<i>Tonight, I have nothing to fear.</i>

216
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:35,287
<i>I'll become a warrior.</i>

217
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,040
Bring it on, you damn mutt.

218
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:42,836
You ungrateful mongrel.

219
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,006
Do you know
how many sausages I've given you?

220
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:57,476
<i>I want to bleed like a fountain.</i>

221
00:26:24,086 --> 00:26:26,213
<i>When I wander around aimlessly,</i>

222
00:26:27,005 --> 00:26:29,758
<i>I can catch the briefest glimpse.</i>

223
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:34,888
<i>"So that's what is in my head."</i>

224
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,945
<i>The feeling of being abandoned.</i>

225
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:20,183
When they first told me it was cancer,

226
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:24,897
I thought, "Right, I haven't taken care
of my health. I should get it together."

227
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:29,693
And when I relapsed, my first thought was,
"Don't let Hyeon-a go."

228
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:32,529
"It's going to be tough this time.
I need her."

229
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:35,198
Even if I'm going to hell,

230
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:38,285
I don't think I'll be afraid
as long as you and Hyeon-a are there.

231
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:41,788
I guess I know
why people used to be buried alive.

232
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:45,042
Even emperors
who ruled over everything were afraid.

233
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,627
Let's all go together.

234
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,545
Why do I have to follow you there?

235
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:50,505
It's not like we dated.

236
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,382
The whole time I was with Hyeon-a,

237
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:54,760
it felt like I was
in a relationship with you, too.

238
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:57,262
When I hadn't even met you once.

239
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,806
She talked about you all the time.

240
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,809
Who likes hearing his girl
go on about some other guy?

241
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,105
Though she kept denying
that there was anything between you.

242
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:11,568
You might not feel anything for her,
but I'm sure she does.

243
00:28:11,652 --> 00:28:13,570
Are you sure you're sick?

244
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:17,991
I'm excited, imagining us all
going to hell together.

245
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:21,036
I said I'm not going!
I'm not following you there.

246
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,205
-Are you nuts?
-I'm free to dream, aren't I?

247
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,123
I've got a great imagination.

248
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,668
We'd have fun together even in hell.

249
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:30,504
What a smooth talker.

250
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,049
Why do you drag me into this?
We're not that close.

251
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,176
Why do you think it's about us?

252
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,220
It's about you and Hyeon-a.

253
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:45,727
The medicine has improved,

254
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,063
so I haven't lost much hair.

255
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:51,191
Is your hair
your biggest concern right now?

256
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,278
What about you, then?

257
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,948
You're worried your dad will
scold you, in front of a cancer patient?

258
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:07,833
It's not that big a deal.

259
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:17,884
You're here?

260
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:20,470
Looks like you partied hard tonight, too.

261
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:28,854
See you tomorrow.

262
00:29:28,937 --> 00:29:30,856
Thank you, get home safe.

263
00:29:34,776 --> 00:29:37,404
Take the glitter off your face at least.

264
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,489
Gosh, you reek of alcohol.

265
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:03,347
Get up already!

266
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:08,518
Aren't you going to work?

267
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,839
Why aren't you washing up?

268
00:31:05,992 --> 00:31:08,954
What an idiot. Gosh.

269
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:11,623
Be quiet. I'm already annoyed.

270
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:13,959
When will you tell them?

271
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,253
-I will.
-When?

272
00:31:16,336 --> 00:31:17,504
For God's sake…

273
00:31:23,093 --> 00:31:25,679
-Mom, this brat quit his job!
-Hey!

274
00:31:31,768 --> 00:31:34,020
SANPO SINKS

275
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,814
Damn it!

276
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:59,337
People are waiting.

277
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:01,965
Let's talk to him after we're done.

278
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,612
I don't know anymore.
I'll be dead meat later.

279
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:55,727
<i>Whenever I wanted to quit,</i>

280
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,439
I'd think,
"Maybe after the summer vacation."

281
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:02,901
"Maybe after Chuseok."

282
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:04,486
Then I'd think,

283
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,405
"I'll be lonely at the end of the year."

284
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,783
"And working isn't so bad in spring."

285
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:12,452
And another year would go by.

286
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:13,995
I mean,

287
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:19,084
I'm not like A-reum, a greedy workaholic
whose only goal is making money.

288
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,878
I think I've come

289
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,131
far enough.

290
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,093
This isn't the right path for me.

291
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,221
I don't have to force myself
to keep walking on it.

292
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,559
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

293
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:37,352
As if I don't understand.

294
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:46,069
To tell you the truth,

295
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:49,239
I don't have a specific goal in my life.

296
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:53,118
Money, women, honor… Nothing.

297
00:33:54,619 --> 00:33:55,537
But…

298
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,622
do I…

299
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:01,167
have to have a goal?

300
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:04,170
Can't I just live my life without one?

301
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:09,175
I can't force myself to live
for something I don't really desire.

302
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,353
<i>I wish I had an older brother.</i>

303
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:23,857
<i>Then I would be able to live as I wished.</i>

304
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:27,402
<i>He doesn't exist,</i>

305
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:29,571
<i>but I miss him.</i>

306
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:47,839
Did someone die or something?

307
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,886
He's worked at that company
for eight years. That's enough.

308
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:55,513
It's hard to get a job somewhere else
after you turn 40.

309
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,807
The younger you are, the better.

310
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:01,603
Young people these days
move from one job to another really often.

311
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,484
Staying at the same job for long
isn't considered a virtue anymore.

312
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:11,071
How do you know what suits you better?
You have to try different workplaces.

313
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,208
So?

314
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:26,252
What's your plan?

315
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:33,927
I'm not going to do anything
for a little while.

316
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,639
How long is a little while?

317
00:35:44,688 --> 00:35:45,605
Dad…

318
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:51,611
Can't you treat me
even half as well as you treated Gu?

319
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,447
You'd worry about Gu

320
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:58,910
if you hadn't seen him in a while.
"Is he sick? Did he eat?" But to me…

321
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,677
I know I'm not a perfect son or anything.

322
00:36:16,845 --> 00:36:19,139
But I haven't done
anything I'm ashamed of.

323
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:22,100
There are so many bad people out there,

324
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:25,478
but I've never done anything
to be an embarrassment to you.

325
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:29,691
The thing I brought home the other day.
I said it was from the company,

326
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:32,360
but it was from the store owners
who heard I was quitting.

327
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:36,781
There are even people who promised
to gift me 500,000 won when I get married.

328
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:39,701
But do you think
they were all nice from the beginning?

329
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,828
No, I had to work really hard!

330
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:45,665
You work with machines.
You don't have to talk to anyone,

331
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:48,334
so you have no idea
what it's like to work with people.

332
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,547
But I still never lost my temper
or got myself into trouble.

333
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,633
They even gave me gifts.
That should be enough!

334
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,471
It's not like I'm going
to idle away for the rest of my life!

335
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:06,478
"You've worked really hard."

336
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:08,313
"Take a break."

337
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:10,899
Can't you just say that?

338
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,181
It's huge!

339
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:49,140
Look at this.

340
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:51,267
-Amazing!
-Check this one out!

341
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:52,310
-Mom.
-Dad,

342
00:39:52,393 --> 00:39:53,353
-What?
-look at this.

343
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:56,064
What's that? Hey, wait. Stay there.

344
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:57,106
Oh, my God.

345
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,942
Hey, take a picture of us.

346
00:39:59,025 --> 00:40:00,109
Mom, look.

347
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:02,070
Look this way.

348
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:05,323
One, two, three.

349
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:07,700
Let's take a group picture.

350
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,410
-Shall we?
-Yes.

351
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,746
One, two, three.

352
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,374
One more, smile!

353
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:19,587
Look.

354
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:23,758
-Sweet potatoes keep coming out.
-They grew so well.

355
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,677
That's odd.

356
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,262
It's right next to ours.
Why did theirs grow so poorly?

357
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:29,764
-Look at this.
-Gosh.

358
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:32,767
Just because you farmed for long
doesn't mean you're good at it.

359
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,061
You need to learn the know-how.

360
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:36,479
Exactly.

361
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,857
These days, it's easy to learn things

362
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,402
-Yes.
-Goodness, we'll be rich.

363
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,904
All right.

364
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,200
-Dad, this is seriously awesome.
-There's more here. Good.

365
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,160
-Take a picture.
-One, two, three.

366
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:53,705
These are seriously huge!

367
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,206
Don't!

368
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:47,759
How dare they…

369
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,472
Fine, let's do it.

370
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,865
Let's go!

371
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:29,592
Nice!

372
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,677
Please, don't!

373
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,887
Nice one, Dad!

374
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:43,731
We almost caught up with them, Dad!

375
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:50,780
Yes, let's go.

376
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,574
Dad, step on it!

377
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:54,700
Step on it, Dad!

378
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:33,447
Dad…

379
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,867
-Christ…
-My goodness.

380
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,035
Be careful!

381
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:44,959
Gosh…

382
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:48,004
-Are you okay, Mom?
-You little…

383
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:49,005
Hey, what…

384
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,715
-You should have stopped him!
-Wait…

385
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,884
-"Step on it"? You idiot!
-Hang on.

386
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,594
Step on what?

387
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:56,179
-Wait, Mom.
-Step on what?

388
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,685
Are the sweet potatoes really
the priority right now?

389
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:08,357
God, I can't believe it.

390
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,110
-I can't believe it, you brat!
-Stop, Mom.

391
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,361
-It hurts.
-You!

392
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,121
For the love of God.

393
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:26,250
Poor me, I have to cook
even after crashing into a rice paddy.

394
00:44:46,896 --> 00:44:48,105
Sell the field

395
00:44:48,189 --> 00:44:50,399
whether or not
you hire someone for the factory.

396
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,402
Farming is too much.

397
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:55,363
Tending the crops that grow like crazy,

398
00:44:55,446 --> 00:44:57,657
sowing and harvesting them…

399
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,742
God, I can't do it anymore.

400
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,289
You just eat, put down your spoon,

401
00:45:05,373 --> 00:45:07,792
and go back out to the field
or the factory.

402
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,711
But I have to follow you around

403
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:14,590
coming in and out of the house
dozens of times to cook for you.

404
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:18,552
And it's not like I have any days off.

405
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:21,389
It's 365 days a year.

406
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,725
I had a day off
when we used to go to church.

407
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,688
But you couldn't even let me have that
and stopped going.

408
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,107
I'm going to start attending church again!

409
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,278
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

410
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,947
Why am I sweating so much?

411
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:45,871
Did you finish work?

412
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:48,958
Well, something suddenly came up.

413
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,044
I think I'll be a bit late today.

414
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,380
Then I'll go first and wait for you.

415
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,465
Well…

416
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:58,175
I think I'll be done quite late.

417
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,262
If it gets too late, I can just go home.

418
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,973
Don't worry about me
and focus on your work. Bye.

419
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:10,104
On days like this, just go home early!

420
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:13,774
You'll fall sick, dating that hard.

421
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:15,985
How can you go
and see him every single day?

422
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:17,903
It's close by, anyway.

423
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,507
I tried imagining it.

424
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,761
If I were your age

425
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,638
and my dad got a girlfriend…

426
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,142
I'd hate it too.

427
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,271
What would that lady have to do
for me to like her?

428
00:46:53,481 --> 00:46:56,317
I'd hate it if she tried hard
to get close to me,

429
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,112
and I'd hate it if she treated me
like a thorn in her side, too.

430
00:47:00,821 --> 00:47:03,824
I could reluctantly accept her

431
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,661
if she were a selfless, independent woman.

432
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:14,502
So today, I tried to look like
a selfless, independent woman,

433
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:16,003
chattering away by myself,

434
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,427
but all those words I said
to make you accept me

435
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,014
didn't seem to work at all.

436
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,434
So I'm a bit sad.

437
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:39,693
I'm going to start crying.

438
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:48,452
Hi. You're back late.

439
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,413
Where's your Auntie Hui-seon?

440
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:52,581
She went to the store.

441
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:53,833
And left you here alone?

442
00:47:56,752 --> 00:47:57,711
What about your dad?

443
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,213
He says he'll be late.

444
00:48:05,136 --> 00:48:06,470
Why are you here every day?

445
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,556
Do we owe you money or something?

446
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:37,877
I'm not leaving.

447
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:39,879
Not until I see Tae-hun.

448
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:01,275
Think carefully.
It's not easy to raise someone else's kid.

449
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,527
Even raising my own kids
drives me up the wall.

450
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,864
That's because they're your own kids.

451
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,325
Do you know how much
you can hate someone else's kid?

452
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:17,041
I didn't say we're getting married!
We're just dating!

453
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,043
Goodness me, just dating?

454
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:20,794
Once you get attached, that's it.

455
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,633
For God's sake.

456
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,594
I should have cut him off then and there.

457
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,764
He would've found someone else to marry.

458
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:36,727
Why did I feel sorry for him
when he looked so down?

459
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,896
Now I'm his personal cook.

460
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,616
I'll just stop by and take a look.

461
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,287
I'll be able to tell
if he's the one for you.

462
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:56,830
Forget it!

463
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,459
I can just walk past
and take a quick look.

464
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,710
Before it's too late.

465
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:04,463
Seriously!

466
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,351
-Yes,
-Thanks.

467
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:34,201
This place used to be really small.
It seems they've expanded it.

468
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,414
We used to come here a lot
when I was living with my aunt.

469
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,125
I think Gyeong-seon told me.

470
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,084
Really?

471
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:03,897
I heard the <i>sujebi </i>here is really good.

472
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,983
-Yes, it really is.
-I see.

473
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:09,111
I'm reminded of how
I used to have them when I was little.

474
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:11,864
Plus, octopus is pretty healthy, I hear.

475
00:51:11,947 --> 00:51:12,906
Yes.

476
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:17,870
I still have the memories
of eating here when I was little.

477
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:19,913
-I see.
-Yes.

478
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,966
I ordered a seafood pancake for you, okay?

479
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:32,885
And I paid the bill.

480
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,721
Enjoy your meal.

481
00:51:36,305 --> 00:51:37,306
Okay.

482
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:51,153
-The food's good here.
-I see.

483
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:53,530
Who…

484
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,075
Shall I order something else, too?

485
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,036
No, it's fine, thank you.

486
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,258
Who was that?

487
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,846
-My mom.
-What? Gosh, your mother?

488
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,264
No!

489
00:52:20,432 --> 00:52:23,352
Damn it, she was supposed
to act like she didn't know me.

490
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:36,411
Hello.

491
00:52:36,995 --> 00:52:40,248
Long time no see!
Did you go somewhere today?

492
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:43,085
Yes, to see someone.

493
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,587
I heard you're selling your field.

494
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,382
Yes. Gosh, I can't do it anymore.

495
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,592
Of course not, at your age.

496
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:52,636
You've got the factory
and the chores at home.

497
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,847
If you marry a workaholic,
it's the woman who suffers.

498
00:52:55,931 --> 00:52:56,765
Exactly…

499
00:52:57,432 --> 00:52:58,517
Hye-suk!

500
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,060
Did you find your dog?

501
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,645
-Sorry?
-Your family dog.

502
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:03,021
-Did you find it?
-What?

503
00:53:03,105 --> 00:53:05,065
When have we ever had a dog?

504
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,316
What?

505
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:09,236
A while ago, I saw Mi-jeong
crying her eyes out,

506
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,239
and when I asked her what was wrong,
she said she lost her dog.

507
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,782
It was about a month ago.

508
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,836
-Three of these, please.
-Sure.

509
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,589
If it wasn't a dog, what was it? A goat?

510
00:54:58,553 --> 00:55:00,305
Your percentage has gone up even more.

511
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,187
Yeom Mi-jeong is moving in
for the final blow.

512
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,856
VOTE

513
00:55:20,909 --> 00:55:23,411
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHERE ARE YOU?

514
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:28,792
YEOM MI-JEONG:
WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG?

515
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,044
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG

516
00:55:34,506 --> 00:55:36,341
YEOM MI-JEONG:
HURRY UP

517
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:37,759
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

518
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:40,387
YEOM MI-JEONG:
I MISS YOU!

519
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:55,402
<i>Yeom Mi-jeong!</i>

520
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,239
Ms. Contest Winner, are you heading home?

521
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,657
Are you bailing on us?

522
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,702
Let's party hard tonight.

523
00:56:03,785 --> 00:56:06,621
You're the winner,
so you can party super-duper hard,

524
00:56:06,705 --> 00:56:09,249
and I'm the runner-up, so just super hard.

525
00:56:10,208 --> 00:56:11,293
What do you want to do?

526
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:16,506
Is there anything
you wish to happen today?

527
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:19,426
No.

528
00:56:21,636 --> 00:56:24,139
-Why does she always turn us down?
-Why not?

529
00:56:25,223 --> 00:56:26,266
<i>Come to me.</i>

530
00:56:28,435 --> 00:56:30,270
<i>I want you to come to me.</i>

531
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:07,766
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

532
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:16,399
SOMETHING GOOD WILL HAPPEN TO YOU TODAY

533
00:57:56,022 --> 00:57:57,273
{\an8}<i>He's coming.</i>

534
00:58:00,485 --> 00:58:01,736
{\an8}<i>He came.</i>

535
00:58:13,748 --> 00:58:14,666
{\an8}<i>He is…</i>

536
00:58:16,376 --> 00:58:18,003
{\an8}<i>waiting for me.</i>

537
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:47,634
Can I help you?

538
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:51,262
Right, well…

539
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,432
Is this…

540
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:58,144
Is this not Yeom Je-ho's house?

541
00:59:58,853 --> 01:00:00,939
Yes, it is.

542
01:00:01,773 --> 01:00:03,358
What brings you here?

543
01:00:08,196 --> 01:00:10,448
Honey, come out here!

544
01:00:10,532 --> 01:00:11,574
Someone's here!

545
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:45,942
You're here.

546
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:37,243
So he's Mr. Gu.

547
01:01:39,537 --> 01:01:43,249
Gosh, I'm going to cry at this rate.
Goodness me.

548
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:52,258
Not long after you left,

549
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:55,845
she passed away.

550
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,015
That fall.

551
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:04,354
She went into the bedroom
to lie down for a bit

552
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:06,981
but didn't wake up again

553
01:02:07,732 --> 01:02:09,525
and passed away.

554
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,740
Leaving the rice cooker on.

555
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,248
The rice is burning!

556
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,172
Gosh.

557
01:02:32,924 --> 01:02:34,550
The rice is all burned.

558
01:02:37,345 --> 01:02:38,221
Mom?

559
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:45,937
The rice is all burned.

560
01:02:50,024 --> 01:02:50,984
Mom!

561
01:02:57,699 --> 01:02:58,574
Mom…

562
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:03,037
Mom!

563
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:05,039
Mom!

564
01:03:05,623 --> 01:03:08,001
Mom!

565
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:11,087
Mom!

566
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,589
Mom!

567
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:19,512
Dad!

568
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,732
Dad!

569
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,198
Dad!

570
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:54,482
Even when you don't know how you'll go on,

571
01:04:55,983 --> 01:04:57,610
if you pull yourself together…

572
01:05:00,154 --> 01:05:02,281
you can still find things
that are bearable.

573
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:09,539
The kids went through a lot.

574
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,043
The three of them

575
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:17,338
have all gone to live in Seoul.

576
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:58,004
YEOM MI-JEONG

577
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:11,267
Yeom Mi-jeong…

MY LIBERATION NOTES

01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:48,513
<i>Do grownups get sad, too?</i>

581
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,014
<i>When their moms are gone.</i>

582
01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:53,142
I don't even care if we're family.
I won't see you again!

583
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:57,855
<i>So now, she would be blameless
if she decided to move out.</i>

584
01:06:57,939 --> 01:07:00,983
<i>Is this Yeom Mi-jeong?
This is Choi Jun-ho's wife.</i>

585
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,153
<i>I knew he was having an affair.
And with whom.</i>

586
01:07:04,237 --> 01:07:05,571
<i>Hey. What are you doing?</i>

587
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:07,532
<i>Why are you ignoring me
after proposing to me?</i>

588
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:09,784
<i>Hyeon-a won't say yes, anyway.</i>
