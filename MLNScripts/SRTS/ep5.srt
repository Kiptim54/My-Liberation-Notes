MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,999
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:15,774
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,924
Wait here.

6
00:00:58,508 --> 00:00:59,676
I'll go.

7
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:10,914
I'm getting goosebumps.
Why am I getting goosebumps?

8
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,334
Gu, you're not some regular guy, are you?

9
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:59,462
You used to be a national athlete, right?

10
00:03:00,588 --> 00:03:01,464
I mean, Gu…

11
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:05,969
Why is someone like you
picking peppers in the countryside?

12
00:04:27,508 --> 00:04:28,634
Go wash up.

13
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:00,208
Wash up and come eat.

14
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,905
Why are you wearing a hat
when we're eating?

15
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,367
They said I should avoid the sun.

16
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,704
Good going, wasting
your money just to get uglier.

17
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,728
Gosh.

18
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:06,607
Are there this many track and field
athletes with the last name "Gu?"

19
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,569
Can you just tell me your name?

20
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:13,865
Gu Jin-seok?

21
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,076
Gu Ja-yoon?

22
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,207
Just wait and see. Your name
must be in here, I'm telling you.

23
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,168
Gu Ja-gyeong!

24
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:27,170
Will you just eat?

25
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,796
Fine.

26
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,260
Gu Chang-mo?

27
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,306
Gu Chang-mo?

28
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,851
I can't believe I know Gu Chang-mo.

29
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,353
No, that can't be.

30
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,856
Even if I know, I should pretend I don't.

31
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,441
I don't know anything.

32
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,776
Gu Yoon-hoe?

33
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,539
Gu Bon-gyeong?

34
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,045
You're really perfect
for track and field, Gu.

35
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:14,008
You know, those who challenge
their limits all on their own usually have

36
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,468
a solitary side, right?

37
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,930
What's your specialty? The 800m?

38
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:24,644
Just let me rest.

39
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,605
All right.

40
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,067
I have nothing to say, okay?

41
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,778
And nothing I want to hear.

42
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:36,739
Okay.

43
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:56,008
Where are you going?

44
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,510
To your house.

45
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,441
Thank you
for thinking of us too. I feel bad.

46
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,568
How was the party?

47
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,361
Good, everyone ate and left.

48
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,321
Your mom will be cleaning up for a while.

49
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:19,699
We all helped before we left.

50
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,326
I'm sure
there's still a lot of work left to do.

51
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,708
Come on. Be careful.

52
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,335
Why does it have to be here?
It'll be noisy.

53
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,630
How can we drink in the yard?
Your dad's there.

54
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,756
My God!

55
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,010
What's with your face?

56
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,678
It's under construction.

57
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,489
Gi-jeong, come join us!

58
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,328
I can't drink if I want
these bruises to go away!

59
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:07,413
What did she do to her eyes?

60
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:08,998
I have no idea.

61
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,708
What about her eyes?

62
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,545
Why didn't you bring a table or something?

63
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,005
Just eat, dumbass.

64
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,089
My back hurts!

65
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
He suddenly started running,

66
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,985
and from that moment,
it was awesome. I could just feel it.

67
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,237
"He'll make the jump"

68
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,697
And he did.

69
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,450
Like paper flying through the air.

70
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,285
Anyone can do that if they train.

71
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:47,370
You think you can?

72
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:48,788
I can.

73
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:50,665
Bullshit.

74
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,458
Care to bet? How much?

75
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,377
If you do it within a week, 500,000 won.

76
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,545
A week isn't enough.

77
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,130
Then within a month.

78
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:00,883
You won't make it, moron.

79
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:03,886
It was scorching today.
My scalp felt as if it was melting.

80
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,056
"So this is how I kick
the bucket, picking peppers."

81
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,518
"Peppers, me, and the sun…"
My mind was all over the place.

82
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:14,146
But seeing Gu jump
like that really blew my mind.

83
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,986
It's a skill I would've shown off
right away, but he hid it for a year.

84
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:26,450
Someone who knows how to hide
how cool he is, is a genuinely cool guy.

85
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:31,664
I knew Gu was special.

86
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:33,707
I could tell by his face.

87
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:38,546
How could you tell that by just his face?

88
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,005
I just can tell.

89
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,301
A face like yours or mine says,

90
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:48,264
"Yes, I'm nothing special.
What you see is what you get."

91
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,557
You little…

92
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,351
We're much better off.

93
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:55,855
Those who seem special but are not,

94
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,940
they're way more disappointing.

95
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,944
We're not like that. We're just
a little disappointing at first sight.

96
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,364
Take him for example.

97
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:08,159
Whenever he sees a girl
he doesn't know at a school reunion,

98
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:09,785
he goes quiet and acts cool.

99
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,121
But oddly enough, when he does that,

100
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,290
it somehow actually looks cool.

101
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,585
So some girls are attracted to him
and go on a few dates with him.

102
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,963
Then they won't even go near him.
They all just avoid him.

103
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,756
Hey, that's not true.

104
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,341
It is true, dumbass.

105
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,844
That habit's like a disease, man.

106
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,096
When you first meet someone,

107
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,516
you should act like you're nothing special
to keep their expectations low

108
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,602
and show them your good points later on.

109
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:38,063
Then you should say,
"What? You noticed that?"

110
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:42,109
"You're right. I can see that's my charm.
I had no idea."

111
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:44,403
But you're all about bluffing.

112
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,447
Then what am I supposed to do?

113
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,324
Act like you're nothing special!

114
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,825
I really am nothing special!

115
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,163
Nothing about me is special!

116
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,875
Look carefully. There must be something.

117
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,213
Ask a woman to find it for you.
They'll do all the work.

118
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,759
Mi-jeong! Are you on a diet?

119
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:08,719
Yes!

120
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,430
All right, do your best!

121
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,849
I hope you'll get prettier.

122
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,113
Do we not have a new one?

123
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,616
No, I've been meaning to buy one.

124
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,246
I'll go pick one up.

125
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,165
This late at night?
We'll just get it tomorrow.

126
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:56,141
Why am I feeling sad?

127
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,187
Why am I sad?

128
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,117
He always holds back.

129
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:16,370
He takes a step forward but then stops.

130
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,708
<i>I'm just going to
keep wanting until the day I die.</i>

131
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,751
Mi-jeong.

132
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:26,463
Don't ask for love like me.

133
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,472
I'm a great person.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,976
I won't ask to be loved.

135
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,938
I'm a great person.

136
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,150
I won't ask to be loved.

137
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,743
I asked him what he stares at
every day in the yard.

138
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:57,661
He said mountains.

139
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:03,500
<i>He said if you piled up 7.7 billion 1-won
coins, it'd be as big as that mountain.</i>

140
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,048
Why 7.7 billion coins?

141
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,342
Don't you get it?

142
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,764
I got what he was saying right away.

143
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,849
It's 7.7 billion.

144
00:14:20,517 --> 00:14:22,311
What about 7.7 billion?

145
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,314
The world's population, moron.

146
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:29,777
Let's say I'm a 1-won coin. Then
7.7 billion coins are about 5,000 tons.

147
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,111
As heavy as that mountain.

148
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,197
If you convert the whole thing into coins,

149
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,990
everything becomes much clearer.

150
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,742
Me and the world's population.

151
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:39,161
So?

152
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,455
Jeez.

153
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:45,459
I'm trying my best to live.

154
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:50,047
But would you even be able to find me,
just a coin, in that mountain of coins?

155
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,302
Are they sorted by country?

156
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,888
Hey, just forget it. Just stop.

157
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:01,475
Why wouldn't we be able to find you?
We're not piled up like a mountain.

158
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,518
That's not it, idiot!

159
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,311
Enough about Mr. Gu!

160
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:06,772
It's just something some alcoholic said.

161
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:09,441
It must have been
one hell of a long jump. Damn it.

162
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,612
Damn it.

163
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:18,200
How dull my life must be…

164
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,495
It's not like I saw Yuna Kim jump.

165
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,956
It was just some guy,
but I'm excited all day.

166
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:29,753
I've never felt real joy,
pleasure, or excitement in my life.

167
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:34,091
Except during the 2002 World Cup.
And then it was over.

168
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:39,722
That's why I'm going on
and on about it like this.

169
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,850
As I go on about it this way,

170
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,520
it somehow makes me feel
something similar to joy, you know?

171
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,732
Goodness. Take this.

172
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,359
Here.

173
00:15:57,364 --> 00:15:59,867
You guys may have gotten older,

174
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,078
but it's just like when you used to
play house here as kids.

175
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,872
Your bodies got bigger,

176
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:07,833
but you're still the kids
who used to put grass on bottle lids

177
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,418
and serve it up saying, "Enjoy."

178
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:11,545
When the time is right,

179
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:15,466
you're supposed to meet your life partner,
get married, have kids,

180
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,217
and watch them grow up.

181
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:20,345
How come so many kids these days

182
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,557
refuse to do that
and just grow old all alone?

183
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,144
Shouldn't something have changed
since back when you used to play house?

184
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,520
My goodness.

185
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,315
You must be sick of it, too, right?

186
00:16:31,398 --> 00:16:32,775
Even I can tell.

187
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,199
Try having a kid.
You'll feel full without eating.

188
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,577
Every day will be amazing.
You'll be invincible.

189
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,288
No one can beat you.
No one can beat parents.

190
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:50,709
But you don't know anything about that.
Goodness gracious.

191
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:52,711
Mother.

192
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,048
After you had us,

193
00:16:56,757 --> 00:17:01,053
you enjoyed two or three short years
of joy and delight,

194
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,223
then your life got miserable.

195
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,309
Do you really want to pass
that kind of life onto us?

196
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:08,227
You little…

197
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,480
And if we want we want
to feel joyful at all times,

198
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,151
should we keep having kids
until we're 80? Until we die?

199
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:21,949
It's hot. Why do you close the window?
You don't even turn on the AC.

200
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,871
What do I do? It's so delicious.

201
00:17:28,455 --> 00:17:31,959
I was full, but this is so good.

202
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,633
Goodness. All he knows
is how to run his mouth.

203
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,034
You may have gotten bigger and taller,

204
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,870
but it's still you.

205
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:09,329
Right?

206
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,251
I don't expect anything from you.

207
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:16,295
I'm just happy when you smile.

208
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:20,883
And when you cry, I wonder what happened.

209
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:25,554
Quit pigging out, asshole!
Your stomach's going to pop.

210
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,598
-Are you jealous of this?
-Shut up.

211
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:36,148
Just his size has changed.

212
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,069
SUPERMARKET

213
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:04,009
I'm a great person.
I won't ask to be loved.

214
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:08,513
I'm a great person.
I won't ask to be loved.

215
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,374
I bought some soju.

216
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,182
Take this.

217
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:57,562
How much was it?

218
00:19:58,981 --> 00:19:59,856
It's fine.

219
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:02,943
Do you even have money?

220
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,739
Enough for that.

221
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,581
Are you sure?

222
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,925
That you and I

223
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,512
will have become
different people when spring comes?

224
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:40,355
You said I would if I worshipped you.

225
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,706
You've never tried it, right?

226
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:04,129
In my experience, you change once
you do something you've never done before.

227
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:20,645
Have you decided to do it?

228
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,150
I already started.

229
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:27,194
Earlier today.

230
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:59,017
Don't give me that.
Do you know how sad it makes me?

231
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:00,018
I know, dumbass.

232
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:02,604
-Hey.
-I have the most hair around here.

233
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,941
Keep it down! Call it a night already!
Don't you have work tomorrow?

234
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:09,528
ALPHA RETAIL

235
00:22:11,571 --> 00:22:14,699
I guess she's really upset.

236
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,828
Did I tell you?

237
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:21,540
That my niece passed
the Grade Seven Public Service Exam?

238
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:22,582
Yes.

239
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:27,003
So I took her to the mall
to buy her a set of clothes,

240
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:30,006
but the sales clerk asked
if we were friends!

241
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,511
She's 27 years old.

242
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:37,722
I felt so bad for her.

243
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,975
But she's still sore about it.

244
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,979
Take a look. This is me and my niece.

245
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:46,565
Do we really look like friends?

246
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:48,692
Yes. You really do.

247
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,193
Really?

248
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,572
Did I tell you already?

249
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:56,783
Two years ago,
I went to a bar with a hat on,

250
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,743
and they asked me for my ID.

251
00:22:58,827 --> 00:23:00,495
I was with all my friends too.

252
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,664
-<i>Help, please call me.</i>
-I was the only one they asked.

253
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,708
My friends were so mad…

254
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:05,750
Yes, sir.

255
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,295
-I wasn't going to tell you this--
-How can I help you?

256
00:23:08,378 --> 00:23:11,047
Yes, I was just wondering
about the work dinner.

257
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:12,382
Yes, indeed.

258
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,217
That's right, yes, that's today.

259
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:15,969
Then I'll see you this evening.

260
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:17,512
Yes, goodbye.

261
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:18,430
Goodbye.

262
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:31,818
Cho Gyeong-seon?

263
00:23:31,902 --> 00:23:33,195
Yes, Cho Gyeong-seon.

264
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:37,365
I've never seen people whispering
while drinking at a barbecue place.

265
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,120
Yes, it was Cho Gyeong-seon.
But how come none of us recognized her?

266
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:45,415
I didn't recognize her, either.
Then I saw her name tag.

267
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:48,001
I realized only after
reading the name tag.

268
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:50,378
But that man.

269
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,714
<i>-He works at Mi-jeong's company, right?
-Yes.</i>

270
00:23:52,797 --> 00:23:55,342
-Then was he her little brother?
-Yes.

271
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:58,053
My gosh. That poor thing.

272
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,513
Oh, no. He even has a kid.

273
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,265
I know, right?

274
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:06,269
Cho Gyeong-seon as a sister-in-law.
Isn't it obvious why they got divorced?

275
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,231
Hey, keep it down.
You'll get in trouble again.

276
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,110
Apparently, he and his two sisters
all live together with his kid.

277
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:15,820
-The three of them?
-Yes.

278
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,323
-Gyeong-seon hasn't gotten married?
-Of course not.

279
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:20,242
Her sister hasn't either.

280
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:23,787
Oh, my God. That guy has it so tough.

281
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,789
You know what she's like.

282
00:24:25,872 --> 00:24:29,709
Remember when she turned
the teachers' room upside down?

283
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:30,669
What?

284
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:33,171
-You haven't heard that story?
-No.

285
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:36,299
She went to get her official
school records to apply for jobs.

286
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:40,345
Apparently, her second-year homeroom
teacher wrote just two words on it.

287
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:41,972
"Poor behavior."

288
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,057
Unbelievable.

289
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,976
Wait, who was the teacher?

290
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,852
German, Class 2-8.

291
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,604
Oh, God, German.

292
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,273
She turned the place upside down,

293
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,776
saying he was stopping her
from getting a job and ruining her future.

294
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,569
Even the police came.

295
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,239
She wasn't exactly a model student.

296
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:04,035
The teacher kept giving her a hard time
since she'd transferred from Seoul.

297
00:25:04,661 --> 00:25:08,498
In the end, he totally
screwed up her life with two words.

298
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,918
Eun-woo went to
Cheongryang Night School, right?

299
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,545
-Yes.
-She saw her on campus.

300
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:17,632
And she thought, "What's she doing here?
Didn't she hate studying?"

301
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,259
And it turned out

302
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:22,304
Gyeong-seon couldn't get a job
with "Poor behavior."

303
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,431
She needed a college diploma.

304
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,518
She said she went to college
thanks to that teacher.

305
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,023
That's crazy.

306
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:36,776
You can't really see the bruises.

307
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,528
I put on a ton of concealer.

308
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:41,990
Gyeong-seon's sister's bar
is just over there past that alley.

309
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:42,991
Do you want to go?

310
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,910
We weren't even that close.
I am curious, though.

311
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,996
One beer before we go home?

312
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,835
If Gyeong-seon hears about
what you said back, you're screwed.

313
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:54,961
She'll pull out your hair.

314
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,047
I doubt he'll tell her.

315
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,340
His kid will.

316
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,634
Don't go. It's better not to get
involved with her.

317
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:07,557
And the treatment wasn't that cheap.
You paid as much as you should.

318
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,441
<i>How did the lottery tickets I gave
your brother the other day turn out?</i>

319
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:18,026
<i>What lottery tickets?</i>

320
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:20,820
<i>Your brother didn't let me
pay for the food,</i>

321
00:26:20,904 --> 00:26:22,530
<i>so I gave him some lottery tickets.</i>

322
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,866
<i>I got them from someone too.</i>

323
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,368
<i>Did he win any money?</i>

324
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,703
<i>Hold on, let me ask.</i>

325
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:31,081
Why isn't she texting me back?

326
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,097
Gift card number.

327
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:49,349
Where's the number?

328
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:50,892
ILHAENG GIFT CERTIFICATE

329
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,981
So that's where you scratch off.

330
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,900
There it is.

331
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:04,989
Five, three,

332
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,575
two, one, six.

333
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:10,829
You're so fast.

334
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:13,581
There. Click there.

335
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:16,459
Don't act like you know.

336
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,550
Watch and learn.

337
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:27,387
Soon, you and I won't even
know how to turn on the TV.

338
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,180
I'm home.

339
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,559
You're late. Have you eaten?

340
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:33,810
Yes. I ate.

341
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:36,521
What are you doing?

342
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:41,234
Hold on. I had something to ask you.

343
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:45,071
What was it?

344
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:47,699
I forgot. What was it?

345
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:50,994
Whatever.

346
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,371
Right!

347
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:54,789
Hey, Cho Tae-hun!

348
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:05,425
<i>Hey. He says none of them were winners.</i>

349
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:17,228
<i>Not even one?
He didn't even win 5,000 won?</i>

350
00:28:22,358 --> 00:28:23,276
<i>No.</i>

351
00:28:28,364 --> 00:28:30,658
"No"? Is that it?

352
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:46,883
GONDAL-RO ENTRANCE

353
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:12,200
Hey.

354
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,493
Did you just get back?

355
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:14,744
Don't make me talk.

356
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:16,788
I have to keep my momentum.

357
00:29:17,372 --> 00:29:18,915
If I stop, I won't make it.

358
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:22,168
I think I get why old people jaywalk.

359
00:29:22,836 --> 00:29:24,295
Once you stop, you can't move.

360
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:26,381
You have to keep going.

361
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:34,097
With all the strength
you have left after work,

362
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,559
you always drink
and take the last train home!

363
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,143
I respect you, Gi-jeong!

364
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:41,563
You got this! Keep going all the way home!

365
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:42,522
I got this.

366
00:29:43,356 --> 00:29:44,399
I can do it.

367
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:07,714
If I die,

368
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,051
it will be because of
commuting to Seoul for work.

369
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,096
Aren't you going to wash?

370
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,989
I wish there was a machine to wash you.

371
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:50,548
Are you a man or a woman?

372
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:01,559
There are only two ways to make money now.

373
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:04,562
Cryptocurrency, or becoming a YouTuber.

374
00:31:06,189 --> 00:31:07,440
What else is there?

375
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:11,069
Nothing. And who here has what it takes
to be a YouTuber? No one.

376
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,780
So cryptocurrency is the only way.

377
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,033
I've heard a lot of people made
a fortune investing in cryptocurrency,

378
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,743
but never actually seen one.

379
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,412
Shall I show you?
I know tons of people who have.

380
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,581
Either way, stocks are best.

381
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:27,251
Your L Electronics stock
must have skyrocketed these days.

382
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:31,422
-I sold that ages ago, man.
-See? Crypto is better.

383
00:31:31,506 --> 00:31:33,299
Just try putting in ten million won.

384
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,926
I don't have that kind of money.

385
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:38,554
Is your mom
still confiscating your salary?

386
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,726
Even banks let you off if it's been
five years since you messed up.

387
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,103
Your mom…

388
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:49,816
Does your mom invest it or something?
What does she do with your salary?

389
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:51,109
She saves it, I guess.

390
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,654
Hey, go right now and tell her,

391
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:58,783
"Mom, housing prices
are the lowest right now."

392
00:31:58,866 --> 00:32:01,202
"I must buy a house immediately."

393
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:03,830
"Even if I have to take out a loan,
I must buy a house."

394
00:32:03,913 --> 00:32:05,581
"Mom, saving it is…"

395
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,750
Chang-hee, you…

396
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:09,669
Do you think I don't know that?

397
00:32:09,752 --> 00:32:11,504
Don't order me around.

398
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:16,384
She yelled at me to take the table away,
saying her sales were dropping.

399
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,679
I almost thought
I was from a rival company.

400
00:32:19,762 --> 00:32:21,472
We work for the same company!

401
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,058
She only cares about her own stuff.
She's so greedy.

402
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,059
Chang-hee…

403
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:26,978
sits next to Jeong A-reum.

404
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,732
For two years.

405
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:35,028
Hey, Yeom Chang-hee
doesn't have to pay today.

406
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:37,697
-Not for the rest of his life.
-That's right.

407
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,992
Being next to her must be tough.

408
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:46,497
Whenever A-reum opens her mouth,
it makes me feel so suffocated.

409
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,292
I can't even stand
the sight of her circle contacts now.

410
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,337
Her eyes are soulless.
It's suffocating to be looking at her.

411
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:57,133
My blood pressure's going up
thinking about it.

412
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,887
I only see her once or twice a week,

413
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,765
but it feels like
she's ruining my entire life.

414
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:08,978
A-reum just talks so much
that it bores people to tears.

415
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,358
I know.

416
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,320
I talk a lot too.

417
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:21,657
Well…

418
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:24,327
I find it fun to hear you talk.

419
00:33:29,624 --> 00:33:31,417
You've fallen for me.

420
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:37,965
Every time I hear your voice,
my ears prick up.

421
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,384
"Yeom Chang-hee's talking!"

422
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,810
You really have fallen for me.

423
00:33:58,277 --> 00:33:59,987
Why are you suddenly quiet?

424
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,072
I don't know.

425
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:02,949
-Say something.
-I'm embarrassed.

426
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,118
-Good night.
-See you!

427
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,536
Bye, get home safe!

428
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:07,787
-Call me!
-Yes, sure.

429
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,163
-Don't drink too much.
-Okay.

430
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,414
I'll call you! Bye.

431
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:11,999
-Where?
-Yeom Chang-hee!

432
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,628
You're with us, pal.

433
00:34:16,337 --> 00:34:17,922
-Why are you going this way?
-Am I?

434
00:34:18,005 --> 00:34:19,090
Am I?

435
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:20,508
-Something's up.
-How suspicious.

436
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,425
Bye.

437
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:24,345
-How fishy. Something's up with them!
-What are those eyes?

438
00:34:24,428 --> 00:34:25,763
Where do you think you're going?

439
00:34:25,847 --> 00:34:27,557
We were all going for a second round.

440
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,145
-What's this?
-What's going on?

441
00:34:32,228 --> 00:34:34,063
-What's going on here?
-My gosh.

442
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:35,857
-What the…
-What?

443
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:39,277
-When did that start?
-Look at him smile.

444
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,486
Let's go.

445
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,328
DRINKING COFFEE LIKE IT'S WATER

446
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:51,914
EITHER BE SUPER HOT OR NOT AT ALL!

I don't mean to be fussy about it.

451
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:42,179
But you know,
I also have to report to someone.

452
00:35:42,263 --> 00:35:43,931
There must be some kind of document

453
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:46,225
to show what it is you do
at the Liberation Club.

454
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,189
Do you have anything?

455
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:54,734
Like, "this is what we do?"

456
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:58,362
Anything?

457
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,206
Then how about keeping
a journal of your activities?

458
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:22,178
Do we need to have our diaries
checked at our age?

459
00:36:27,224 --> 00:36:28,893
Why is this making me so mad?

460
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:34,106
I must be the problem.

461
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:40,821
My father passed away when I was young.

462
00:36:42,948 --> 00:36:44,658
Weirdly, it was my dad's handwriting

463
00:36:45,326 --> 00:36:48,579
that reminded me of him the most.

464
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,418
I didn't feel much
when I saw his clothes or photos of him,

465
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:58,506
but his handwriting
weirdly really reminded me of him.

466
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:05,096
He wasn't one to use a pen a lot,
so he just had the one address book.

467
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:08,974
I looked at it every day.

468
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:15,356
And this was written in the book.

469
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,361
"What does a man live for?"

470
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,164
I'd never thought
he would ponder things like that.

471
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,143
The weather's so hot.

472
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:07,760
SOJU

473
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,990
Why don't you just buy four bottles?

474
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:13,450
Then you won't
have to come back later. It's hot.

475
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:21,977
Did you have dinner?

476
00:41:24,021 --> 00:41:24,980
I didn't feel like it.

477
00:41:27,649 --> 00:41:28,734
What are you doing later?

478
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:38,243
What can I do
with your whole family around?

479
00:42:53,444 --> 00:42:54,486
Goodness.

480
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,114
Shouldn't you just get me a new one?

481
00:42:57,197 --> 00:42:59,700
You scrape it off, and then it comes back.

482
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:01,201
It's no use.

483
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:04,830
That's just what happens to freezers
that are kept outside in the summer.

484
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:08,083
This is hard work.
I could have done it myself.

485
00:43:15,215 --> 00:43:16,758
Chang-hee!

486
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:20,471
-Why won't you check your messages?
-What messages?

487
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:24,183
The group chat! Are you ignoring it?

488
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:38,614
Seeing how she keeps
sending messages in the group chat,

489
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:42,117
I think she's waiting for you to reply.
Why aren't you responding?

490
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:48,665
Given the mood that night, it seemed like
you'd text her right away to ask her out.

491
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:49,583
Why didn't you?

492
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:53,712
Haven't you gotten over Ye-rim yet?

493
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:56,757
There's nothing to get over.

494
00:43:58,592 --> 00:43:59,551
Then what?

495
00:44:03,347 --> 00:44:06,934
Isn't Da-yeon on par with Ye-rin?

496
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:09,394
Sure.

497
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:12,272
Then why aren't you calling her?

498
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:16,401
The fact that she's on par
with Ye-rin means

499
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:22,699
that she's the kind of woman
who wants a kid.

500
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:28,580
And I think the kind of woman
I'm drawn to deserves that kind of life.

501
00:44:28,664 --> 00:44:33,210
But the problem is, I'm not
a man who can offer that to her.

502
00:44:38,215 --> 00:44:39,800
So that's my dilemma.

503
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:45,973
And because I keep dating girls
without resolving this dilemma,

504
00:44:46,056 --> 00:44:47,724
I keep breaking up with them.

505
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:51,353
Would it be any different with Da-yeon?

506
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,732
What she wants is obvious,
and I know I can't give it to her.

507
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:59,861
You can just date her for now.

508
00:44:59,945 --> 00:45:02,364
Do you think she just wants to date?

509
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:04,700
She's not getting any younger either.

510
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:23,427
Yes.

511
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:27,514
Yes.

512
00:45:28,807 --> 00:45:30,517
Of course. Yes, I know.

513
00:45:34,354 --> 00:45:35,397
Yes.

514
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,315
I see.

515
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:46,241
Yes.

516
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:48,744
Yes, goodbye.

517
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:52,205
Don't mention it. Yes. Bye.

518
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,669
CALL ENDED
BYEON SANG-MI

519
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:00,315
Why aren't you asleep?

520
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:05,737
I'm hungry,
but there's nothing I want to eat.

521
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,201
Then it's not food you want.

522
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:11,404
He wouldn't let me pay for the food.

523
00:49:11,488 --> 00:49:14,866
I said I'd pay for it all,
but he insisted on leaving it out.

524
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,494
Store owners don't actually
mean it when they say that.

525
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:20,413
If I insist,
they let me pay for all of it in the end.

526
00:49:20,497 --> 00:49:21,540
But he didn't do that.

527
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:25,085
"Yes, this guy's pretty great."

528
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:27,379
So I gave him all ten tickets.

529
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:29,548
Plus, I made a mistake the other day.

530
00:49:30,465 --> 00:49:32,717
I'm sorry
for giving the tickets to someone else.

531
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,222
You look much softer
when you're talking about him.

532
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:42,561
No, I can't. He even has a kid.

533
00:49:42,644 --> 00:49:45,814
So what?
It's not like you're going to marry him.

534
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:47,357
"Anyone this winter."

535
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,818
He works at the same company as my sister,

536
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:52,195
so if it goes badly,
it'll be awkward for her too.

537
00:49:52,279 --> 00:49:56,199
And he's my friend's younger brother,
and she's really something.

538
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:00,912
But despite all that,
you already fell for him.

539
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:09,754
As soon as someone catches my eye,
I fall in love with them.

540
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:11,548
I don't go through the stages.

541
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:14,259
Other people take an interest
and slowly grow to care

542
00:50:14,342 --> 00:50:18,054
for the other person
before they really fall in love with them.

543
00:50:18,555 --> 00:50:21,391
With me, it just happens right away.

544
00:50:21,474 --> 00:50:26,229
From the very beginning,
I immediately fall madly in love.

545
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:28,857
How did this happen? What did he do?

546
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:33,320
It's so embarrassing
that I can't even talk to anyone about it.

547
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:35,780
I understand.

548
00:50:36,406 --> 00:50:39,117
I'm also a little like that.

549
00:50:42,454 --> 00:50:45,707
The strange thing is,
I didn't feel tired for a few days after.

550
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,836
Because I was thinking of him,
I barely felt tired.

551
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,048
That's why I love.

552
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:54,924
You can't feel tired if you're in love.

553
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:58,887
But all ten tickets I gave him
were losers,

554
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,348
so I had no other reason to contact him.

555
00:51:01,431 --> 00:51:03,975
I started feeling tired
right after I found out.

556
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:07,812
The back of my neck got stiff,
and I got all grumpy again.

557
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:09,981
I'm sorry.

558
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,817
How could you have such bad luck?

559
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:16,279
What do I do then?

560
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:18,281
Shall I buy you more?

561
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:22,952
For me to give them to him?
Just keep getting him lottery tickets?

562
00:51:36,716 --> 00:51:38,677
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

563
00:51:39,177 --> 00:51:42,013
<i>Why can I not stop thinking about him?</i>

564
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,018
<i>I must be crazy.</i>

565
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:53,274
STORE-OWNER BYEON SANG-MI

566
00:51:56,903 --> 00:51:58,405
Welcome.

567
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:17,507
What can I get you?

568
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:20,427
I'm Yeom Chang-hee's girlfriend.

569
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:24,264
Ex-girlfriend, that is.

570
00:52:28,768 --> 00:52:32,981
I really want to get back with Chang-hee…

571
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,028
But every day he spends an hour
sitting out on the street on his own.

572
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:43,491
While we watch a movie,
he goes out to take a call,

573
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:45,910
and I end up watching it alone.

574
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,208
I want to smash his phone.
It's just too hard for me.

575
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,044
I'm so sorry. I really am.

576
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,088
How can I make it up to you?

577
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,716
What do I do?

578
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:04,137
Take him back, okay?

579
00:53:04,637 --> 00:53:09,350
When I heard that you broke up
because of me, I felt absolutely terrible.

580
00:53:09,976 --> 00:53:10,935
I'm sorry.

581
00:53:11,686 --> 00:53:14,230
Take him back, all right?

582
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,274
I promise

583
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,069
that I will restrain myself from now on.

584
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:22,614
But that will still be
30 minutes on the phone.

585
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:27,994
I'll keep it under ten.

586
00:53:31,873 --> 00:53:33,708
My ex-husband used to run this store.

587
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:35,585
But that asshole cheated on me.

588
00:53:35,668 --> 00:53:41,549
He used to stand here with her
pretending to be a married couple.

589
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:46,221
I got this convenience store as part of
the alimony when we got divorced,

590
00:53:46,846 --> 00:53:51,976
but the only person who knows
both of them is Mr. Yeom.

591
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:55,438
I want to bad-mouth them.

592
00:53:56,815 --> 00:54:00,652
I want to bad-mouth them so badly.

593
00:54:02,237 --> 00:54:04,030
Don't cry.

594
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:05,448
What do I do?

595
00:54:06,783 --> 00:54:09,160
Don't cry, all right?
Please don't cry. Stop.

596
00:54:12,413 --> 00:54:15,124
I saw you suffering
because of her countless times.

597
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,709
How did you know where it was?

598
00:54:16,793 --> 00:54:18,503
Dogok-dong, Byeon Sang-mi. It's easy.

599
00:54:18,586 --> 00:54:20,463
I just visited a few convenience stores.

600
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:24,551
But still, pick up her calls sometimes.

601
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:26,094
I do pick up.

602
00:54:28,847 --> 00:54:30,974
I'm so good at solving
other people's problems.

603
00:54:31,057 --> 00:54:32,475
Should I open a business?

604
00:54:33,893 --> 00:54:35,687
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

605
00:54:36,312 --> 00:54:37,522
Buy me a drink.

606
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:40,984
Let's go.

607
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:44,237
What do you want to eat?

608
00:54:44,863 --> 00:54:45,780
Chicken feet?

609
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:48,825
Does that mean I have a girlfriend again?

610
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:50,702
It's better that way, you know?

611
00:54:50,785 --> 00:54:53,371
You can use it
as an excuse when necessary.

612
00:54:55,748 --> 00:54:57,208
-Gosh.
-It's hot.

613
00:55:06,843 --> 00:55:07,802
This is nice

614
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:18,688
A PERSON THAT I JUST LIKE

615
00:55:18,771 --> 00:55:23,026
When I thought about it,
I didn't have anyone like that.

616
00:55:24,569 --> 00:55:28,364
If I think about it,
the people that I thought I liked

617
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,117
all have things
that make me uncomfortable.

618
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,787
Things that disappoint me.

619
00:55:35,496 --> 00:55:37,373
Things that I hate.

620
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:39,459
Things that I'm jealous of.

621
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:42,795
They all have things that make me unhappy.

622
00:55:44,547 --> 00:55:47,634
I might seem to be getting along
with people without any problems.

623
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:49,218
But in truth,

624
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:52,805
there's not a single person I truly like.

625
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:57,602
I'm wondering if that's why

626
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,689
I'm being drained without realizing it.

627
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:06,235
If it's why I always feel alone

628
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:09,197
and also as if I've been abandoned.

629
00:56:31,135 --> 00:56:33,846
Hey. Here. Your pay for the week.

630
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:36,015
Thank you.

631
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,268
I should be thanking you.

632
00:56:41,521 --> 00:56:44,983
SANPO SINKS

633
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:22,729
Excuse me.

634
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:27,442
Could I have
your youngest daughter's number?

635
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,117
Mi-jeong's?

636
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,327
Yes.

637
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,085
Zero-one-zero…

638
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:55,026
-I told you it's good.
-Fine, let's go.

639
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:57,404
Really?

640
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:05,578
I GOT SOME MONEY

641
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:13,628
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO EAT?

642
00:58:16,506 --> 00:58:18,842
IT'S ME, GU

643
00:59:00,216 --> 00:59:04,429
<i>Even the people I think I like,
if I stop and think about it,</i>

644
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:07,223
<i>they all have things
that make me uncomfortable.</i>

645
00:59:08,933 --> 00:59:12,020
<i>There's not a single person I truly like.</i>

646
00:59:13,104 --> 00:59:16,608
<i>I'm wondering if that's why</i>

647
00:59:17,484 --> 00:59:20,028
<i>I'm being drained without realizing it.</i>

648
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:23,531
<i>If it's why I always feel alone…</i>

649

650
00:59:24,574 --> 00:59:27,243
<i>…and also as if I've been abandoned.</i>

651
00:59:27,327 --> 00:59:28,244
YEOM MI-JEONG

652
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:31,372
Is this even possible?

653
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:34,042
It's not even easy to truly like your kid.

654
00:59:38,296 --> 00:59:40,048
<i>I've decided to try finding</i>

655
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:43,093
<i>someone like that.</i>

656
00:59:43,718 --> 00:59:46,221
<i>Even if the other person
blows hot and cold,</i>

657
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:49,224
<i>I won't let myself sway.</i>

658
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,272
<i>I'm going to just keep liking them.</i>

659
00:59:57,982 --> 01:00:00,360
<i>Wouldn't that be better
than dealing with people</i>

660
01:00:01,027 --> 01:00:02,737
<i>without any purpose?</i>

661
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:07,408
<i>I want to try living differently.</i>

662
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,596
Why don't you have anyone you like?

663
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:11,389
You have your family.

664
01:01:13,892 --> 01:01:18,271
I don't love everything
about my mom and dad.

665
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:20,732
I dislike my brother and sister a lot.

666
01:01:23,234 --> 01:01:24,569
I just feel sorry

667
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:26,613
for my dad.

668
01:01:29,574 --> 01:01:32,202
<i>I don't think he's ever been happy.</i>

669
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:38,458
<i>And I think my mom thinks
she's unhappy because of her kids.</i>

670
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,879
So I say this when something bad happens.

671
01:01:42,962 --> 01:01:45,840
"It's fine as long as
Mom doesn't find out."

672
01:02:05,568 --> 01:02:07,070
Do you think lies will work?

673
01:02:07,654 --> 01:02:09,239
"You're pretty," "You're cool."

674
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:11,699
You can say whatever you want.

675
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:19,499
But the moment you say it,
it'll become the truth.

676
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,960
All words are like that.

677
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:28,549
Try it. Just say anything.

678
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:57,524

MY LIBERATION NOTES

680
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:08,107
<i>I'm as happy as when I get my paycheck
whenever you message me.</i>

681
01:04:10,068 --> 01:04:11,235
She must be out of her mind.

682
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:13,196
You're making me look really bad here.

683
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:15,782
<i>Apparently, A-reum has poached
three stores that way.</i>

684
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:19,160
From now on, I'm going to put my life
on the line and love A-reum.

685
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:21,496
<i>I have to listen to their gibberish.</i>

686
01:04:21,579 --> 01:04:24,082
My heart started pounding,
and I couldn't say anything.

687
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:26,834
<i>I thought I had done something wrong.</i>

688
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:28,127
<i>I'm going to practice now.</i>

689
01:04:28,753 --> 01:04:30,963
<i>What could you practice
with that alcoholic?</i>

690
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:32,799
<i>All the neighbors know.</i>

691
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:36,219
I don't care
even if the whole world disproves.

692
01:04:36,302 --> 01:04:37,762
<i>I let them in too much.</i>

693
01:04:37,845 --> 01:04:39,722
Why don't you keep going?

694
