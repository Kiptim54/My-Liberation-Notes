1
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,068
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:15,784
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:16,978
SOY SAUCE

4
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,271
-It's okay.
-All right.

5
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:19,730
-Thank you.
-Take care.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,027
SUPERMARKET

7
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,544
This car even rattles differently.

8
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:57,643
I've seen them on the road before,

9
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:00,479
but it's my first time meeting
someone who drives one.

10
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:03,107
-I'm honored.
-It's nothing.

11
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,902
-May I shake your hand?
-Right.

12
00:01:05,985 --> 00:01:07,653
I'm his friend.

13
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,989
Right…

14
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:14,702
It would be hard to park this kind of
big car in an apartment complex.

15
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:16,162
You don't live in one, right?

16
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:17,872
No…

17
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:21,292
I knew it. You can't own this kind
of car if you live in an apartment.

18
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:23,669
You've succeeded at such a young age.

19
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:29,300
Well, it's not my car.
It's my sister's boyfriend's.

20
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,552
I see.

21
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:35,264
Still, it's really cool, you know?

22
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:37,767
-It's amazing.
-How much does one of these cost?

23
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,352
-Well, I'm not sure exactly.
-Hi.

24
00:01:39,435 --> 00:01:41,312
-But the price wouldn't matter…
-All right.

25
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,605
…to people who choose to drive them.

26
00:01:42,688 --> 00:01:46,984
You're right. Those who can afford
this car wouldn't think about the price.

27
00:01:47,068 --> 00:01:49,487
-Mom says to come home already.
-It must be expensive.

28
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:52,323
-When could we ever buy this kind of car?
-I know.

29
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,492
-I hope you have a good day.
-Yes.

30
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,577
-Anyway, this car's amazing.
-Thank you.

31
00:01:56,661 --> 00:01:57,536
All right.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,080
Gosh, there's a mark here.

33
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,582
She says she needs the soy sauce
to marinate the meat.

34
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,210
All right, well.

35
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:05,836
-Of course.
-All right.

36
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:17,890
Did somebody visit? What's that car?

37
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,945
It's my friend's.
I'm keeping it for him for a while.

38
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,950
That friend of yours
must not be Chang-hee, then.

39
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:38,869
It looks very expensive.

40
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,873
Of course. That car
costs hundreds of millions of won.

41
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:47,044
That friend had to go abroad…

42
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,966
He left it here since he had to
go abroad for a while. Yes.

43
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,265
Hey, Chang-hee.
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

44
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,313
What time?

45
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:09,275
Why do you ask? That's so random.

46
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,485
You'll drive the car, no?

47
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,238
Are you just going to leave it there
until he comes back?

48
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,781
So what time?

49
00:03:16,574 --> 00:03:19,327
Why would I give you a ride
and ruin my day from the morning?

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,917
Don't drive someone else's car.

51
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:50,775
What did Mr. Gu use to do?

52
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,027
I don't know.

53
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,739
But I feel like
I have to keep it that way.

54
00:03:56,822 --> 00:04:00,242
I have a feeling that he'll disappear
with the car as soon as I ask

55
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,161
"What did you use to do?"

56
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:06,499
You can't buy this kind of car
just because you have money.

57
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,251
The guy who drives this car

58
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:13,005
is working under your father?

59
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:14,924
At a sink factory?

60
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:18,594
That's why I'm saying
we should keep it from my dad.

61
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,389
He's working so hard teaching Gu.

62
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,973
If he finds out he owns this car,

63
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,768
he'll lose his motivation.

64
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:28,396
Yes. I understand.

65
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:35,403
Mi-jeong's really struck gold, hasn't she?

66
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:42,952
Don't feel small.

67
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:44,954
You're all right.

68
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,813
So, what time are you leaving tomorrow?

69
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:12,982
Don't even dream of it.

70
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,317
But it's her boyfriend's car.
Why can't she?

71
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:16,986
I'm not riding it.

72
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,155
Why not?

73
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:21,907
There'll be traffic.

74
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,870
We need to leave at 6:30
to avoid rush hour.

75
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:27,413
Can you leave by that time?

76
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,291
I can just sleep in the car.

77
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:50,436
Are you nervous?

78
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,069
Have some guts, okay?

79
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,530
Everything good in this world
could be yours.

80
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:04,366
Why can't you believe that?

81
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,079
The best man and all the money
in the world could be yours.

82
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,122
Shut up.

83
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:18,297
Lend me some money next time.

84
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,721
Actually, why would I borrow it?
Just give it to me.

85
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:35,272
How fast can it go?

86
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,066
Shall I step on it?

87
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,902
-Shall we take the highway, sir?
-Hey.

88
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,321
Why would you do that in a car like this?

89
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:45,491
You should go slow as if to tell everyone,

90
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,703
"I'm someone who drives a luxury car."

91
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:54,542
Go slow. Stop at all the signals.

92
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,585
Yes, sir.

93
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,133
I feel like this is too good for me.

94
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,594
I don't feel like I belong here.

95
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:08,722
This is way out of my league.

96
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,850
I can't even show off in it.

97
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:13,310
I feel the same.

98
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:17,064
I feel weirdly embarrassed
when I get in and out of this car.

99
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,276
Maybe I'm worried other people
will realize it's not mine.

100
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,902
Let's get used to it.

101
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:25,698
"I am worthy of good cars like this!"

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,075
"I'm worthy!"

103
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:44,550
CHOI JUN-HO

104
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,971
Where do you even get

105
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:50,806
those kinds of pants?

106
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:53,851
Wait…

107
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:58,188
Maybe I should ask when you got them.

108
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,950
I mean, it's been ages since I saw
a woman in trousers that are heavy

109
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,411
at the bottom.

110
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,001
Don't you feel stuffy

111
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,296
just looking at them?

112
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,048
It's suffocating.

113
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:35,517
Detail is important
in both fashion and design.

114
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:37,186
Detail…

115
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,565
<i>Asshole…</i>

116
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,817
Who uses shadows on fonts these days?

117
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,238
He should know the trends
in his field better.

118
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,094
Shall we go together?

119
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:25,858
You're wearing comfortable shoes.

120
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,320
I have my walking club today.

121
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,363
Really?

122
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:33,408
I'm thinking of doing a marathon club.

123
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:36,828
Do we have a marathon club?

124
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,246
I'm going to make one.

125
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,998
Do you want to join?

126
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,418
I don't think they'll let you.

127
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,588
There's even a liberation club.

128
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,049
Why not a marathon club?

129
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,804
I heard vigorous sports are not allowed

130
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,389
since you could get injured.

131
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:57,640
Really?

132
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,315
What do you do in the Liberation Club?

133
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,322
What are you being liberated from?

134
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,450
Work?

135
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,495
From people.

136
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,498
From tedious people.

137
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,871
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

138
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,125
<i>My face is burning up.</i>

139
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,506
<i>I feel like I'll collapse.</i>

140
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,932
<i>What do you want to eat?</i>

141
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,313
<i>I want to drink alcohol.</i>

142
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,155
That son of a bitch.

143
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:43,955
He treats being out of fashion
as if it makes you a peasant.

144
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:53,005
I guess it's natural
that the asshole I hate hates me.

145
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,299
But I probably hate him more.

146
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,177
I loathe him.

147
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,266
He may be somebody at work,
but he's a nobody outside.

148
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:09,689
My company once asked
for voluntary resignations to downsize.

149
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,234
Competent people who I wanted to stay
volunteered to go.

150
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,611
Since they're wanted everywhere.

151
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,531
But those I want to leave never do.

152
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,285
Since they have nowhere else to go.

153
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,121
And that's how that jerk is still here.

154
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,667
The weaker you are, the more evil you get.

155
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,795
That's why evil people…

156
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,881
have a pitiful side to them.

157
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:40,469
Invite him over, okay?

158
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:43,806
Bring him here.

159
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,144
Let's teach him a lesson in the field.

160
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:50,438
You'll win.

161
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,693
Of course I will.

162
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,666
I've never…

163
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,295
felt better after getting angry.

164
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,425
It would take me two to three days
to forget about it if I didn't get angry,

165
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,218
but if I get angry,

166
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:24,096
it lasts more than ten days.

167
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,278
In the evening,

168
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,073
the wind blows from this side.

169
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,999
I've never lived in a house

170
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,169
where the direction of the wind changes
and the moon is visible at night.

171
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,468
<i>I thought such houses
only existed in fairy tales.</i>

172
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:12,455
<i>One day, the moonlight felt</i>

173
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,707
<i>a little odd.</i>

174
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,002
<i>I realized later that the street light</i>

175
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,379
<i>had gone out.</i>

176
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,638
After the light was fixed,

177
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:32,808
it never felt the same again.

178
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,147
I think humans are only sane

179
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:22,858
when they're lonely.

180
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,321
So…

181
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,826
I think I'm saner at night.

182
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:50,678
<i>When I was a child, I was asked to hand in
what we had prayed about at church.</i>

183
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,305
<i>Looking at what my friends wrote,</i>

184
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,016
<i>I thought, "Why would they pray for that?"</i>

185
00:16:57,268 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>"Grades, the school they want
to get into, friends."</i>

186
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,816
<i>"They're seriously praying for that?"</i>

187
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:05,860
<i>"To God?"</i>

188
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,070
<i>"But it's God."</i>

189
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,784
<i>There was only one thing
I was curious about.</i>

190
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:20,124
<i>"What am I?"</i>

191
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,675
<i>"Why am I here?"</i>

192
00:17:36,975 --> 00:17:39,019
<i>I didn't exist before 1991,</i>

193
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:42,147
<i>and I won't exist in 50 years,</i>

194
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:46,318
<i>but I feel like I existed before that
and will still exist after that.</i>

195
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,487
<i>The feeling that I'll exist forever.</i>

196
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,201
<i>I've been frustrated by that feeling,</i>

197
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,869
<i>and I've never, in my heart,</i>

198
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,662
<i>ever,</i>

199
00:17:58,496 --> 00:17:59,998
<i>felt settled.</i>

200
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,211
<i>I feel uneasy in bed,</i>

201
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,129
<i>I feel uneasy around people.</i>

202
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,382
<i>"Why can't I</i>

203
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:12,636
<i>laugh happily like other people?"</i>

204
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:15,889
<i>"Why am I</i>

205
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,183
<i>sad all the time?"</i>

206
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:22,395
<i>"Why am I always nervous?"</i>

207
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:24,689
<i>"Why is</i>

208
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:26,983
<i>everything so boring?"</i>

209
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:39,913
<i>It feels like people are all scarecrows.</i>

210
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:45,043
<i>They don't really know what they are.
They're just acting as if they do.</i>

211
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:50,298
<i>In a way, people who say
they live healthily and happily</i>

212
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:54,094
<i>may be the people who decided
to put all these questions behind them.</i>

213
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,015
<i>People who have decided to lie and say,
"This is just how life is."</i>

214
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,519
<i>I'll never do that.</i>

215
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:05,272
<i>I don't care
about where I'll go after I die.</i>

216
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,983
<i>I want to see heaven while I'm alive.</i>

217
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:01,763
Why do you have to
wash your hair at night? Damn it.

218
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:27,622
Here.

219
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:28,748
This guy.

220
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,877
Look at him. He's eating them.

221
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,297
This is the asshole I told you about.

222
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,924
He never finishes them.

223
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:39,217
He just eats half

224
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,720
and leaves them for other customers
to buy and file complaints.

225
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:46,516
I would be upset, too, if it was
already half-eaten when opened.

226
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,394
He's so stealthy. He's like a ghost.

227
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:52,063
-I'll report it, okay?
-He'll be released with a warning.

228
00:21:53,648 --> 00:21:56,985
This isn't the first time.
He ate the same product last time as well.

229
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,196
Five times make you
a habitual offender, right?

230
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,074
You'll find more than enough
if we go over the footage.

231
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:04,325
Take a look.

232
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:08,496
Mr. Kim, what was the date when we got
the complaint about that chocolate?

233
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,081
The half-eaten chocolate.

234
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:15,587
<i>Where are you?</i>

235
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,255
<i>I'm heading out now.</i>

236
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:21,968
<i>Hurry up, please rescue me.
My eyeballs are about to fall out.</i>

237
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:24,888
She's in there.

238
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:26,931
She's just pretending that she's not.

239
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:30,059
Open the door. I know you're in there.

240
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:40,028
I wonder if her mother knows
what a nasty bitch her daughter is.

241
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:44,157
A bitch who'd just
date anyone and mooch off them.

242
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,660
Does she know
what kind of money that was to me?

243
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:51,414
Maybe I should take a crap
right here to teach her a lesson.

244
00:22:52,123 --> 00:22:53,625
I mean--

245
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,169
-You…
-Take a crap. Go on.

246
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:59,214
I'll release the CCTV footage
and embarrass you.

247
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:00,965
Go ahead and take a crap!

248
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,467
Why you…

249
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,553
Get her! Someone get her!

250
00:23:05,637 --> 00:23:09,807
That bitch! Somebody grab her!

251
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,518
My God. Hey, stop!

252
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,315
Just wait until I get my hands on her!

253
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,276
Hey, come back here!

254
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:22,862
That nasty…

255
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,451
Why do you want to get a table?

256
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:30,662
Let's just dance
to a couple songs and leave.

257
00:23:30,745 --> 00:23:33,331
It's on me! So don't worry and let's go.

258
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,792
Get out already.

259
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,751
Hey…

260
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,215
Welcome, sir! You can exit the car.

261
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,174
Yes.

262
00:23:54,102 --> 00:23:56,646
Excuse me, sir! I need the key.

263
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:18,001
I don't like it here.

264
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,086
What about there?

265
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,381
-That's a bit…
-Why? How much is it?

266
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:31,889
Just call a driver! I'll pay for it!

267
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,058
There's no way
I'll let anyone else drive it.

268
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:37,770
Hey, give a driver a chance
to drive a car like that.

269
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:40,982
We'll have this one.

270
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:41,899
Of course.

271
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,076
Don't worry. I'll even pay
for all the tips before we leave!

272
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,165
Are you going to die tomorrow?

273
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,059
Today,

274
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,062
I watched CCTV footage
until my eyes popped out.

275
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:22,190
to catch someone who had been
secretly eating a 1,000-won chocolate.

276
00:25:22,774 --> 00:25:25,151
And now I drove
a 500 million-won car to come here

277
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:27,320
to drink a 700,000-won bottle of alcohol.

278
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:29,155
What do you think of that?

279
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:32,825
Do you think I should hand him
over to the police?

280
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,170
You really aren't listening to me today.

281
00:25:48,966 --> 00:25:50,760
I'm only telling you.

282
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:54,263
Don't tell anyone.
I don't want to get murdered.

283
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,272
This is my account balance.

284
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:08,486
My account balance!

285
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:13,825
It's nine digits.
That means a hundred million won!

286
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,374
Where did you get this money?

287
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:24,502
Today, you're a guy who drives
a 500 million-won car.

288
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,671
I'm a woman who has
500 million won in her account.

289
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:27,588
Just enjoy.

290
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,568
Drink up!

291
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,222
Listen carefully.

292
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,559
If I die, I've been murdered.

293
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:25,980
No matter how much it looks
like a suicide, that won't be the case.

294
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,900
I will never commit suicide.

295
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,569
If I die,

296
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,614
I've been murdered
because of the 500 million won.

297
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,933
All that expensive alcohol…

298
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:03,810
Who are you, Jeong A-reum?

299
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:05,978
Saying "This is expensive" all the time.

300
00:28:06,062 --> 00:28:09,065
So what? Do I have to
like everything if they're expensive?

301
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:13,528
You know I don't like loud places.

302
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:16,781
Have you ever seen me go to a club?

303
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,331
Just go to sleep, asshole.

304
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,292
Hyehwa and then Sanpo, please.

305
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:30,100
SANPO SINKS CLOSETS

306
00:30:36,157 --> 00:30:37,033
What are you doing?

307
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:39,692
Nothing.

308
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:03,842
ADD COLOR, ADD SHADOW, UNDERLINE

309
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,510
ADD COLOR, MAKE IT BIGGER, SHADOW

310
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,056
Mi-jeong, are you
really going to change it like this?

311
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,353
I have to if he tells me to.
What choice do I have?

312
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,565
What you did is a hundred times
better than what he told you to do.

313
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:21,818
Everything he does is
just cheap and showy.

314
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:23,987
That's just the kind of man he is.

315
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:28,366
But your work has an elegance to it.

316
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:32,370
Your designs always
make me stop and look at them.

317
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:35,165
That's why I always get jealous
when I look at your work.

318
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,209
Are you really going to edit it?

319
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,717
I want to bring this
to the branding department as it is.

320
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,596
I want them to know
how that man is ruining all this work.

321
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,391
Are you worshiping me?

322
00:31:58,521 --> 00:32:01,357
Ms. Yeom and I
will go to Gwangju next week

323
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,235
and take care of the researcher training.

324
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:09,949
All right, that's all for today.
Good work.

325
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:11,159
Thank you.

326
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:13,578
Good work.

327
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:15,622
Why don't we have lunch together?

328
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:16,706
What do you want?

329
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:20,001
How about dry bulgogi? It's been a while.

330
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:21,419
Sounds great.

331
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:23,546
Don't we have to queue at that place?

332
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:26,507
Please spare me.

333
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:28,801
I can't stand in line right now.
I'm too tired.

334
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,637
You seemed okay for a while.

335
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,388
This comes and goes in cycles.

336
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:34,724
Three days of the week are so tiring,

337
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:36,809
the other three
are just barely manageable,

338
00:32:36,893 --> 00:32:39,562
and I don't even know
how the last day goes.

339
00:32:39,646 --> 00:32:44,234
When I'm tired, just looking at people
queueing makes me angry.

340
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:45,652
It just pisses me off.

341
00:32:46,236 --> 00:32:49,280
That's why I can't take buses.

342
00:32:49,364 --> 00:32:52,325
The queues for the buses
going to Gyeonggi-do are so long

343
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:55,620
that they look like
really long strings of beads.

344
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:59,374
Just looking at it
drives my blood pressure up.

345
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,584
There are just too many people.

346
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:04,462
So it takes forever for my turn to come.

347
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,547
I can't get anything when I want them.

348
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:10,009
I have to wait for everything. For food,
to get back home, and even men.

349
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,223
It seems you're just angry, not tired.

350
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,478
What is it? What made you so angry?

351
00:33:24,357 --> 00:33:26,776
I think I have an inkling.

352
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:35,660
He promised to treat me twice
but hasn't texted me even once.

353
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:37,787
So there is someone.

354
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,625
I'm sure he knows
I'm looking at my phone all day.

355
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,085
Does he?

356
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,629
How could he not?

357
00:33:46,713 --> 00:33:49,215
When I'm emitting
this huge energy into the universe?

358
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,092
How could it not reach him?

359
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:54,429
I mean, it's already been three days
since he promised.

360
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,432
But he hasn't called or texted me.

361
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:02,312
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:05,315
Gosh. He must be psychic.

363
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:13,823
He messaged her.

364
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:17,410
Today?

365
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:19,996
Today is too sudden.

366
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:23,082
Put it off for a few days.
He's had you waiting this long.

367
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,628
Contacting a woman and asking
to meet on the same day isn't polite.

368
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,047
Play hard to get.

369
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,970
It's not interesting
if you say yes at once.

370
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,348
A guy gets anxious the most

371
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:41,142
when a girl plays hard to get.

372
00:34:41,225 --> 00:34:42,894
That's when guys go crazy.

373
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,813
Just relax and put it off. It'll be fine.

374
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:51,778
Let's make him anxious, Ms. Yeom.

375
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,863
Try making a man wait for once.

376
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:56,074
Why do you always
have to be the one who waits?

377
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,634
So when is it going to be?

378
00:35:16,135 --> 00:35:16,969
Tomorrow.

379
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:20,223
Some delay that is.

380
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:24,143
Yes. That's the charm of Ms. Yeom.

381
00:35:27,063 --> 00:35:30,024
But is it a good thing

382
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,068
to make him anxious?

383
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,907
Why is it a good thing? He's anxious.

384
00:35:41,035 --> 00:35:44,122
You get anxious, and it drives you crazy.

385
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,375
Isn't that a bad thing?
It's uncomfortable, isn't it?

386
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:52,630
When a man and a woman like each other,
shouldn't you give each other the fullest?

387
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:55,258
Why would you string it out
in small portions?

388
00:35:55,341 --> 00:35:56,217
What is that?

389
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,678
You'll be murdered
if you feed someone like that.

390
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:01,305
So why do I have to give out
my affection like that?

391
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:05,268
What's good about not getting enough?
Shouldn't you give as much as you can?

392
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:07,854
Getting anxious and playing hard-to-get…

393
00:36:07,937 --> 00:36:12,275
Aren't they all bad things?
Rather than good?

394
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:15,361
I mean,

395
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:18,906
it may not be good,

396
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,033
but that doesn't mean it's bad.

397
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:23,494
It doesn't necessarily mean

398
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:24,871
it's bad.

399
00:36:24,954 --> 00:36:26,581
It's just dissatisfying.

400
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:31,711
Or insufficient, you could say.

401
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,515
She's meeting him today, isn't she?

402
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:46,934
Why had I always believed

403
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,395
that this was a good thing?

404
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,073
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

405
00:37:01,157 --> 00:37:03,910
-Can I park my car there?
-Yes, just leave your number there.

406
00:37:03,993 --> 00:37:05,036
-My number?
-Yes.

407
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:37,777
Hi.

408
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,028
Hi.

409
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:41,656
Is it here?

410
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,032
No.

411
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:45,910
It's that one.

412
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:56,045
This place is very popular
with drinkers for its food,

413
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,130
so you usually have to
wait for two months,

414
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,425
but someone canceled
their reservation today, so…

415
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,135
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

416
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,512
It's okay.

417
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,847
I'm glad we didn't have to wait.

418
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:15,314
I didn't even ask what you like
and just chose this place on my own.

419
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:17,942
I'm not picky at all.

420
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,072
Sometimes I want to be picky, but I can't.
Even intestines and chicken gizzards.

421
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:25,408
What am I saying?

422
00:38:26,117 --> 00:38:28,077
-What's with me?
-May I take your order?

423
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,079
We'll take Course A.

424
00:38:30,162 --> 00:38:31,539
-Course A it is.
-Yes.

425
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:32,665
For drinks…

426
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,543
I'll take <i>so-maek</i>.

427
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:37,295
Then, one soju and one beer, please.

428
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:39,589
One soju, one beer. Coming right up.

429
00:38:42,758 --> 00:38:44,176
It sounds like English.

430
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:46,387
"<i>So-maek.</i>"

431
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:54,061
You know how we
emphasize the "s" in "soju"?

432
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:56,063
So it sounds more like English. "<i>So-maek.</i>"

433
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:57,565
Right.

434
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,407
Hello?

435
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:12,288
We need to park here.

436
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:14,123
Right. I'll move right away.

437
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:15,082
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

438
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:22,256
-I need to go move my car.
-All right.

439
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,091
-Okay.
-Take your time.

440
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:36,270
This street's one-way, too.

441
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:44,362
I've come too far.

442
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:56,582
PAID PARKING LOT

443
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,875
How long will you stay?

444
00:39:58,668 --> 00:39:59,919
I'm not sure.

445
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,462
We close at 10 p.m.

446
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:05,508
-Well, I'll come back before that.
-Payment?

447
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,926
I'll pay now.

448
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:08,594
Until ten.

449
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:16,560
Hi, where are you?

450
00:40:16,644 --> 00:40:17,687
I'm at home.

451
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,897
Right, did you drink?

452
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,316
No, but I'm going to right now.

453
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,694
Don't!

454
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,781
Come get my car.
I'll send you the address. It's not far.

455
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:54,598
I'm sorry.

456
00:40:55,766 --> 00:40:57,143
It's okay.

457
00:40:57,226 --> 00:40:59,311
I shouldn't have brought my car.

458
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:01,147
The restaurant called out of the blue.

459
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:07,236
The beer's warm now.
Shall I ask for a fresh bottle?

460
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:08,195
Excuse me.

461
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:09,238
No.

462
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:11,824
It's okay. Just catch your breath.

463
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,202
What?

464
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,956
Catch your breath, just for a minute.

465
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:52,615
You didn't have to run.

466
00:41:56,744 --> 00:41:58,704
I parked too far away.

467
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:13,093
Now I can finally drink comfortably.

468
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,141
POWER OFF

469
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:30,069
What do you want for dinner?

470
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:31,904
It's too late to eat, isn't it?

471
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:34,448
Then, what?

472
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,409
I'm tired. I want to go home.

473
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:39,453
Is that so?

474
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:42,164
Why did I wait for you, then?

475
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,629
Shall we go to Paju this weekend?
To see the suspension bridge.

476
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:49,964
I have a study group.

477
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,465
All weekend?

478
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,510
I need to rest for a day.

479
00:42:58,305 --> 00:42:59,139
All right.

480
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,225
That's it, then.

481
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,519
We're over as of today. Goodbye.

482
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:11,026
You study or meet your friends

483
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:13,362
four or five days a week.

484
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,783
But you ask me about who I meet
every time I meet someone. What is this?

485
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,661
We agreed to date
yet have rarely gone out on one.

486
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,582
We see each other every day at work.

487
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:27,334
Do we have to meet up outside too?

488
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,212
Is seeing each other enough?

489
00:43:30,796 --> 00:43:32,715
I see everyone at work every day.

490
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:34,884
If I've seen someone at work
for ten years,

491
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:36,844
have I gone out with them for ten years?

492
00:43:38,178 --> 00:43:39,013
It's over.

493
00:43:42,016 --> 00:43:44,643
People say you're a player.

494
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:51,317
So I was just keeping
an eye on you for a while.

495
00:43:52,026 --> 00:43:53,027
To see if it's true.

496
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,157
I've never taken a break from dating.

497
00:43:58,908 --> 00:44:00,367
But I've never two-timed anyone.

498
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:02,953
Or jumped from one girl to another.

499
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,080
I told you that a few times.

500
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,960
Well, you can keep keeping an eye on me.

501
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:11,670
But I'm done.

502
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,094
This is what always happens.

503
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:23,223
"Do I owe her something?"

504
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:27,686
"Why does it feel like
I owe her something?"

505
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:32,900
I feel frustrated somehow.

506
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:33,859
Yes.

507
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:37,363
So I end up saying, "Let's break up."

508
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:40,949
And that's how it ends.

509
00:44:44,453 --> 00:44:46,580
It really is over now.

510
00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,927
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

511
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,762
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

512
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:06,266
Hui-seon, I'll go pick up the car.

513
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,353
Hurry back. We need to go get
an electric toothbrush for Yu-Rim.

514
00:45:09,436 --> 00:45:11,980
Let's go together now, then.
There are no customers, anyway.

515
00:45:12,064 --> 00:45:13,232
-Shall we?
-Yes.

516
00:45:13,941 --> 00:45:15,192
Thank you.

517
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:17,403
Let's go.

518
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:20,197
If it was around here,
he should've come to our place.

519
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,157
Why is he paying for drinks elsewhere?

520
00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,285
<i>The phone you called is turned off.</i>

521
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,789
<i>You'll be directed to voicemail
after the beep.</i>

522
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:34,420
I…

523
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,508
I think I would be liberated
if I shaved my head.

524
00:45:43,178 --> 00:45:47,266
To me, shaving my head means
that I become a mere animal.

525
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:48,809
A nameless animal.

526
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,729
I feel like it would be all right
to live like that.

527
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:56,400
It's not like I've achieved anything
by trying so hard.

528
00:45:57,401 --> 00:45:59,445
I wish I hadn't been living like that.

529
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:04,742
It just feels like, if I shave my head,
my desire to look nice

530
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,243
and my desire for a man

531
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,537
would all go away.

532
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:11,623
So I've decided.

533
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:15,711
"This winter, I'll either love anyone
or shave off my hair."

534
00:46:15,794 --> 00:46:17,504
"I'll do at least one of them."

535
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:19,590
"If I waver this time,

536
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:23,510
I will be suffering for
the rest of my life because of my hair."

537
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:33,687
Don't…

538
00:46:34,938 --> 00:46:35,981
shave off your hair.

539
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,420
Bingo.

540
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,427
If he was going to eat here,
he should've come to our place.

541
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:06,970
You're dead.

542
00:47:07,054 --> 00:47:09,932
Let's just go.
The supermarket will close soon.

543
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:13,644
I found you. You're dead.

544
00:48:04,111 --> 00:48:05,195
What is this?

545
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,531
Get up.

546
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,996
Leave.

547
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:32,097
Leave.

548
00:49:02,085 --> 00:49:03,295
Who's he drinking with?

549
00:49:06,924 --> 00:49:08,008
Who is it?

550
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:09,968
With his friend. Who else?

551
00:49:27,736 --> 00:49:29,279
Don't shave your head.

552
00:49:34,826 --> 00:49:37,579
I'll do it. I'll be that "anyone."

553
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:16,526
Yes!

554
00:50:37,264 --> 00:50:39,266
ARE YOU ALIVE?

555
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:45,981
The girls are going crazy.

556
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:49,735
It must be so easy
to get a date with that car.

557
00:51:10,658 --> 00:51:11,618
Hi.

558
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,328
Yes, it's been a while.

559
00:51:13,995 --> 00:51:14,829
Yes.

560
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:17,624
-I'll get going.
-What?

561
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,000
-Hey.
-Bye.

562
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,043
Bye.

563
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:33,556
You must manage this area as well.

564
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:36,017
I was recently assigned.

565
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:38,228
We have rotations.

566
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:44,901
Do you want a ride?

567
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:54,827
It's my friend's car.

568
00:51:55,453 --> 00:51:56,829
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

569
00:51:58,998 --> 00:52:02,961
It'll take a long time for you to get back
if you go all the way to my place.

570
00:52:03,544 --> 00:52:06,172
I could never give you a ride
while we were dating.

571
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:07,090
Just get in.

572
00:52:23,815 --> 00:52:26,109
You used to go on and on
about cars all the time.

573
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,027
You're finally driving one.

574
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,280
It's not even mine though.

575
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:33,491
Still…

576
00:52:34,826 --> 00:52:36,828
Not everyone gets to drive
a car this nice.

577
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:42,333
Where have you gone with this car?

578
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:46,212
I visited my grandma's grave,

579
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:48,631
a reservoir in my town,

580
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:52,135
and Yeongjongdo
since the East Sea is too far away.

581
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:57,265
With who?

582
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,976
By myself.

583
00:53:04,564 --> 00:53:06,316
You've only been to unusual places.

584
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:09,402
I thought you'd be
showing it off to everyone.

585
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,029
Me too.

586
00:53:11,571 --> 00:53:13,614
I thought I would be like that too,
you know?

587
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,408
But I didn't.

588
00:53:16,492 --> 00:53:17,618
I didn't know either,

589
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,497
but I become very gentle when I drive.

590
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:30,381
<i>Oddly enough, I become gentle
as soon as I put my hands on the wheel.</i>

591
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,551
<i>When I was little,
I loved looking at atlases.</i>

592
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:36,512
<i>Oddly, I lost track of time
every time I looked at them.</i>

593
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:40,558
<i>I'd go to cities I'd never been to
in my head.</i>

594
00:53:40,641 --> 00:53:45,146
<i>I would go to Chuncheon,
Gwangju, Busan, and even Ulleungdo Island.</i>

595
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,316
<i>It's just like then.</i>

596
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:57,325
<i>I guess I have been putting up
a façade with people.</i>

597
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,037
<i>Now that I'm alone,</i>

598
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,290
<i>I've become so calm and gentle.</i>

599
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,504
<i>What is that? "Being gentle alone"?</i>

600
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:11,964
<i>I don't know.</i>

601
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:13,424
<i>It's just</i>

602
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,010
<i>being gentle on your own.</i>

603
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:28,398
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

604
00:54:32,276 --> 00:54:33,653
I'll see you tomorrow.

605
00:54:58,553 --> 00:54:59,429
Give it back.

606
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:03,224
I've asked around,
and you'll definitely lose if I sue you.

607
00:55:03,307 --> 00:55:05,768
So just give it back
and stop wasting my time.

608
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:10,648
You snuck into the hospital
every night and coaxed a sick kid

609
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:13,860
into selling his house and sending you
the money. There are witnesses!

610
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,736
The nurses and caregivers all saw it!

611
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,449
And the hospital's CCTV
caught you sneaking in every night!

612
00:55:19,532 --> 00:55:20,366
Give it back

613
00:55:21,033 --> 00:55:22,368
before you go to jail!

614
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,745
I will if your son dies! Damn it.

615
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,879
Your kid is worried that I won't visit him
anymore if he doesn't give me money.

616
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,214
So I show him
the account balance every day.

617
00:55:36,924 --> 00:55:39,927
He says he's so scared of dying,
but he doesn't want to die

618
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:41,471
holding his mother's hand.

619
00:55:44,098 --> 00:55:47,852
The hand of a mother who's just crazy
about money even when her kid is dying…

620
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:49,562
Who would want to hold that?

621
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:53,649
I pity him so much that he only has
people like you around him.

622
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:56,152
I'm going to stay with him
until the end, so get lost!

623
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,742
How could you only care about money
when your kid is dying in fear?

624
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:03,868
I'll give it to you.

625
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,579
I'll give it to you
even if he tells me not to.

626
00:56:06,662 --> 00:56:07,830
So just get lost!

627
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:12,293
I hated you from the start.
I should've broken you two up then.

628
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:17,882
It's come to this in the end!

629
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,767
I'm like a dog, you see.

630
00:56:29,685 --> 00:56:32,730
If anyone treats me kindly,
I'm loyal to them forever.

631
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,941
I would give them everything.

632
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:39,237
I would have given you everything, too,
if you said at least one thing kind to me.

633
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:41,989
But you never did. Why?

634
00:56:42,073 --> 00:56:44,116
Shouldn't I have scored
at least 10 points to you?

635
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,661
There must be something
about me worth that much.

636
00:56:47,245 --> 00:56:48,830
If you gave me those 10 points,

637
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:50,998
I'd return the favor
for the rest of my life!

638
00:56:51,082 --> 00:56:53,125
But how is it that you've never
even given me that?

639
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,836
Hey!

640
00:56:54,919 --> 00:56:57,338
Even a single point is too much for you!

641
00:56:57,421 --> 00:57:00,800
People like you
should disappear from the earth!

642
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:03,928
How could I accept a girl
who's been with so many different men

643
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:05,388
as my daughter-in-law?

644
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:08,683
Who knows how you'll end up
humiliating me?

645
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:20,611
WEST BUILDING

646
00:58:01,903 --> 00:58:04,322
YEOM CHANG-HEE:
ARE YOU STILL ALIVE?

647
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:13,372
I AM

648
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:30,389
AND HE IS, TOO

649
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:37,897
<i>You know,</i>

650
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,817
<i>he gave me as much as 60 points.</i>

651
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:44,820
<i>Sixty points.</i>

652
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:48,699
I'll be honest.

653
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,661
Really honest.

654
00:58:52,244 --> 00:58:54,080
I'm not sugarcoating it.

655
00:58:55,998 --> 00:58:59,502
You score over 70 points.
At least 72 points.

656
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:01,295
So…

657
00:59:02,755 --> 00:59:05,049
you should have
more confidence in yourself.

658
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:46,590
SANPO SINKS

659
00:59:59,854 --> 01:00:02,064
Here's your iced Americano.

660
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:12,361
Call Baek now.

661
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:14,738
Call him.

662
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:16,866
It's not Mr. Baek.

663
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:20,452
It's Chairman Shin.

664
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:45,269
It's been a while.

665
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:47,313
It's good to see you.

666
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,272
Me too, sir.

667
01:02:50,816 --> 01:02:57,239
I couldn't find you
so I thought Baek had really killed you.

668
01:02:58,282 --> 01:02:59,742
But you seem to be doing well.

669
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:05,623
When I heard that you were well and alive,

670
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:08,709
I thought you'd be back soon.
But you haven't.

671
01:03:10,044 --> 01:03:12,004
So I wondered if you found someone else.

672
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,841
That's why I had some of my people
watch you.

673
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:20,304
So you're working as a carpenter.

674
01:03:26,101 --> 01:03:28,020
Why don't you come back?

675
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:36,362
I get that people want to steal from me.

676
01:03:37,196 --> 01:03:40,741
It'd be the same even if I put
my family member in that spot.

677
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:44,870
If I can't do anything about that,
I want someone strong there at least.

678
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,205
Someone I can rely on.

679
01:03:48,332 --> 01:03:50,417
Since Baek has taken that spot,

680
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:52,795
I hang my head in shame

681
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:54,964
everywhere I go.

682
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,427
Come back.

683
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,140
What is it?

684
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,351
Do you need more time?

685
01:04:12,398 --> 01:04:13,274
Yes, sir.

686
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:17,361
But what is it

687
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:19,905
that you need to do here?

688
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,710
I worship you.

689
01:05:47,794 --> 01:05:52,734

MY LIBERATION NOTES

<i>Mi-jeong's so lucky, Dad.
She's hit the jackpot.</i>

692
01:06:22,403 --> 01:06:23,570
<i>Give me a name already, okay?</i>

693
01:06:24,154 --> 01:06:26,448
<i>Unbelievable.
Someone joined the Liberation Club.</i>

694
01:06:26,532 --> 01:06:27,658
Welcome.

695
01:06:27,741 --> 01:06:29,368
I'll give you a ride today.

696
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:31,036
Really, I want to give you a ride.

697
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,122
Where else are you going to kiss him?

698
01:06:34,289 --> 01:06:37,251
Well, I was going to go home
then heard Chang-hee was here…

699
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:38,752
<i>Should I give you a ride?</i>

700
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:40,629
-It's a friend's.
-Which friend?

701
01:06:40,712 --> 01:06:42,297
Which friend?

702
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:45,717
<i>I get why he wants to stay here, though.</i>

703
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,137
You just wait there for me,
you son of a bitch.

704
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:51,849
<i>I told you, I don't care
what kind of life you've led.</i>

705
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:54,852
<i>Aren't you angry?</i>
