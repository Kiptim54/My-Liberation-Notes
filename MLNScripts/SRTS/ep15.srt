MY LIBERATION NOTES

3
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:10,124
ALL LOCATIONS, CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

4
00:00:10,212 --> 00:00:11,884
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

5
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,478
What's your name?

6
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:21,027
It's Gu Ja-gyeong.

7
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,866
How did you get my phone number?

8
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:28,760
I went to your house.

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,302
When?

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,990
A few days ago.

11
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:38,935
Why all of a sudden?

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,912
Just because.

13
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:47,908
You must have heard my mom passed away.

14
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:50,721
Yes.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,409
And that my dad got remarried.

16
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,270
What is it?

17
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,612
It's just strange.

18
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,045
So this day came, after all.

19
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:19,545
"When might we meet again, and how?
Will we ever meet again?"

20
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,309
"I'd be so happy
if he called me right now."

21
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,030
When I was sincerely wishing for it,
I never heard from you,

22
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:28,974
and when I least expected it, you…

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,992
What were you doing?

24
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,591
Preparing for war.

25
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:38,692
I was ready
to bring out my evil side today.

26
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:40,553
Against who?

27
00:01:45,474 --> 00:01:47,790
Where are we going, by the way?

28
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:50,850
Good point. Well, it's cold, right?

29
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,456
Shall we go inside somewhere? A cafe?

30
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:56,392
Are you cold?

31
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,790
No. What about you?

32
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,686
I'm alright, too. Let's just walk.

33
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:06,483
It'll be awkward
sitting face to face with a cup of coffee.

34
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,287
Now that I think of it,

35
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:14,009
I've never had
a cup of coffee with you at a cafe.

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,566
Of course not.
How could we while we were there?

37
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,495
We just drank cold water
after picking cabbages and radish.

38
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:27,657
Just as I thought,

39
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,303
we suit the fields better.

40
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:33,446
It's comfortable.

41
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,954
Trees, wind, and rocks don't irritate us.

42
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:43,992
I get irritable
when I'm in places with a lot of people.

43
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,492
Even someone sitting alone at a table
next to mine in a café irritates me.

44
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,842
Even though they're not doing anything.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,185
Maybe we just hate people.

46
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:01,816
I thought I was the only one.

47
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,027
If someone comes your way
when you're walking like this,

48
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,805
don't they irritate you?

49
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,881
Do you think he was irritated by us too?

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,001
When it's one against many,
it's always the one that gets irritated.

51
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,855
The many don't really care.

52
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,735
But the one is always on their guard.
Since they're alone.

53
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,138
I get weird when I'm with you.

54
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,487
I keep saying things I never thought of.

55
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,228
Are we a two? Or just one against one?

56
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,296
Are you drawing a line between us?

57
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,978
Why didn't you call me sooner?

58
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:40,076
GWANGCHANG MARKET

59
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:54,385
They fit you well.

60
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,404
No, I'll pay.

61
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,761
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:03,194
Put it in my bag.

63
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,578
There…

64
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,597
Is it good?

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,966
Excuse me, would you mind moving this
so we can sit here?

66
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:50,876
Sure…

67
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,211
The <i>gimbap</i> is really good here.

68
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,226
SAM-SIK

69
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,331
SAM-SIK

70
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,287
Why are you calling me on a Sunday?

71
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:22,264
Today's Saturday.

72
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,724
Today's Saturday.

73
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,006
I got it. I'll call you back.

74
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,747
What is it?

75
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,529
Just go. You can come back, can't you?

76
00:06:56,423 --> 00:06:57,416
I'll come back.

77
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,627
I'll be back soon. I'll come back.
Go and wait somewhere.

78
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,488
Take your time.

79
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:05,935
I'll be back soon.

80
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,641
-Let's get out.
-Sir?

81
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,254
-Let's run.
-Yes, sir.

82
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,717
What?

83
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,817
-Stop.
-You son of a bitch!

84
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,768
Let me go, you…

85
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,945
Let go of me, damn it. How dare you?
You got me fired.

86
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,302
I'll report all of you, you bastards.
Let go of me!

87
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,997
Let go of me, you bastards!

88
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,215
She's been here drinking since the
early evening, yelling that she got fired.

89
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,103
I knew she was going to cause trouble.

90
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,411
Let go of me!

91
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,859
Hey!

92
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,788
Let me go! I'll report you all!

93
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,137
Let go of me! I said, let go!

94
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,769
I'm reporting you, you son of a bitch!
Let go of me!

95
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,051
Let me go!

96
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:44,698
Let me go! Let me go, you bastards!

97
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:47,758
Let go!

98
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,709
Wait…

99
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:50,736
Let go of me, you scumbags!

100
00:09:50,818 --> 00:09:54,747
-For God's sake!
-Let go of me! You bastards!

101
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:01,571
You changed your number and
ghosted us to get out of paying us back.

102
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,921
But you're upset
we came to your workplace?

103
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,883
Was I supposed to go to you
and gently ask, "Please pay me," then?

104
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,067
Why? Tell me.

105
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:18,154
Why do I have to be respectful of you
when you weren't from the beginning?

106
00:10:19,022 --> 00:10:19,850
Why?

107
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,297
Why?

108
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,955
Hey, Ja-gyeong.

109
00:10:28,038 --> 00:10:29,610
Ja-gyeong.

110
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:34,862
Mr. Gu, there weren't that many customers
yesterday, for real.

111
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:37,922
This is all! I swear.

112
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,396
Check the CCTV footage if you want,
you bastard!

113
00:10:41,478 --> 00:10:43,298
Hey, Ja-gyeong. Wait!

114
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,167
Why?

115
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,558
To play cards all night again?

116
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,018
I didn't mean to do it,

117
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,582
but the gambling debt I racked up before…

118
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:31,683
They'll kill me
if I don't pay it back by today.

119
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:51,534
You must be losing your touch.

120
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,974
You've been cut.

121
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:58,729
It was a bottle, sir.

122
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,144
You must be drinking every day.
Except for maybe a few hours a week?

123
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,378
YEOM MI-JEONG:
TAKE YOUR TIME

124
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,363
Where to, sir?

125
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:41,491
<i>Take your time.</i>

126
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:43,441
JUNGJEONG

127
00:14:36,748 --> 00:14:37,657
It's painted on.

128
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,887
You've come back as a different person

129
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,996
in just an hour and a half.

130
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:50,685
{\an8}Hey.

131
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,455
{\an8}That's life.

132
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,260
{\an8}Just when you think it's going well…

133
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,865
{\an8}I've never even had one whole perfect day.

134
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,692
{\an8}Five minutes a day.

135
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:15,167
{\an8}If you have
five minutes of peace, it's bearable.

136
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:22,073
{\an8}When I hold the door open
for a kid at a convenience store

137
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:25,671
{\an8}and the kid says, "Thank you,"
that makes me happy for seven seconds.

138
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:30,302
{\an8}When I open my eyes in the morning
and remember it's Saturday,

139
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:32,701
{\an8}that makes me happy for ten seconds.

140
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,679
{\an8}Fill up five minutes a day like that.

141
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:40,311
{\an8}That's how I survive.

142
00:15:56,977 --> 00:15:57,928
{\an8}Well…

143
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,120
{\an8}do you still

144
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:02,849
{\an8}live the hard way,

145
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,612
{\an8}trudging on step by step?

146
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:21,790
Let's go together.

147
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:24,767
Step by step,

148
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,538
trudging on.

149
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:29,812
Excuse me.

150
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:30,764
Yes, sir.

151
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,349
A while ago,

152
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:12,367
people had to abandon their cars and walk

153
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,262
because of the heavy snow.

154
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:17,289
I remember.

155
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,514
I also had to leave my car
on Yeongdong Bridge and walk.

156
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:22,789
And I suddenly thought,

157
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:26,345
"If the earth just stopped
for a while like this,

158
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:31,349
I would just keep walking
until I reached Sanpo."

159
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,304
"If I take the shortest route,
it should be about 28km."

160
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,702
"I'd be there by dawn."

161
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:44,996
I was heading there in my head,
figuring out where to make turns.

162
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:46,899
It was funny

163
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:50,786
that I was thinking about walking there
if the Earth stopped,

164
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,936
when I could just drive there.

165
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:01,414
Do you remember

166
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,005
the guy who borrowed my money
and left the country to go back to his ex?

167
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,520
You never told me he went to his ex.

168
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,779
It was that jerk's wedding today.

169
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,693
He still owes me six million won.

170
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:22,506
But he still managed to pay
for all the preparations required

171
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:23,581
and had a buffet.

172
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:28,295
So I said if he had that much money,
he should pay me back.

173
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,645
Then he ranted at me for half an hour.

174
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,092
While I was listening to him,

175
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,988
I broke the cup I was holding.

176
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,465
He must have thought I was the same
Yeom Mi-jeong he remembered.

177
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,758
I decided to go to his wedding

178
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,480
and stand behind the bride and groom
with a really scary expression

179
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:54,845
when they take a photo.

180
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,029
And to take the congratulatory money
on my way out.

181
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,247
I went there determined to do that.

182
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,665
Like you said, it was one against many.

183
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,519
I've decided to be the one
to ruin everything

184
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,538
while the others
are there to congratulate them.

185
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:15,523
"Let's do this."

186
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,880
"It's me against everyone else."

187
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:23,587
When the photographer asked
the friends to come up for a picture,

188
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:25,406
I stood up…

189
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:29,584
and that's when you called me.

190
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:32,644
<i>Hello?</i>

191
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:37,813
<i>Hello?</i>

192
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,031
<i>It's been a while.</i>

193
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,388
<i>It's Gu.</i>

194
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,205
"This man…"

195
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:56,257
"He'd never let me hit rock bottom."

196
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:00,765
"He's stopping me."

197
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,224
Hello?

198
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:08,954
He's not getting up.

199
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,394
Yes, can you come to the station?

200
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,537
<i>JONGNO-GU ALLEYWAY JOURNEY</i>

10TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EXHIBITION
JOSEON'S LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS

202
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:00,334
Hold on.

203
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,068
Don't bother.

204
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,467
There are too many.

205
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,501
This place is freezing!

206
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:37,182
It's broken.

207
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,337
Does the hot water work?

208
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,853
Only warm water.

209
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:06,296
I can't believe
you're living like a refugee

210
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:08,405
in such a nice apartment.

211
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:10,638
An alcoholic

212
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:13,947
just needs a clean glass.

213
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,082
Why don't you hire help? Aren't you rich?

214
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,199
I can't be bothered.

215
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,432
Telling them the passcode

216
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,162
and sending them money every month.

217
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,068
My nose is cold.

218
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,318
Was I an asshole, too?

219
00:23:07,626 --> 00:23:08,991
Not anymore.

220
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,589
You called in the end.

221
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:18,461
But I was an asshole till yesterday?

222
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:50,098
Welcome.

223
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,223
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

224
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,327
Aren't you going to church?

225
00:24:11,272 --> 00:24:12,305
I'm not.

226
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:22,520
What's gotten into you, staying out?

227
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,434
Are you seeing someone?

228
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,825
Aren't you going to church?

229
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,893
I'm not!

230
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,574
So I'll go there tomorrow
with my girlfriend.

231
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,552
Based on the way
things were going at that store,

232
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:53,950
she didn't think
she'd get paid after a month.

233
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,499
So she quit after five days.
She needs to get paid for those five days.

234
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,766
But they keep saying
they'll pay her tomorrow.

235
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,157
So I'll go meet them in person.
Calling them will never work.

236
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:08,465
How shameless of them,
trying to not pay her.

237
00:25:11,237 --> 00:25:13,511
It might not be because they're shameless.

238
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,529
It might be
because they don't have the money.

239
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,507
Are you taking their side
as a store owner?

240
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:23,767
I was once paid a salary, too.

241
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,620
So I know how it feels
not to be paid in time.

242
00:25:27,737 --> 00:25:31,169
But I'm now in no position to curse
at people who can't pay their employees.

243
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:34,768
When I was running a business,

244
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,448
if I could pay my employees
by sacrificing one of my arms,

245
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:41,467
I would have gladly done it.

246
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:45,768
The sweet potato oven business?
Every house has an air fryer now.

247
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:50,400
Not for households, for businesses.
The one that's bigger than that one.

248
00:25:56,727 --> 00:25:59,291
I was so frustrated
and wanted to go somewhere to pray,

249
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,061
but there weren't
any churches open that early.

250
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,254
The only place I could go to

251
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,858
was a convenience store.

252
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:10,581
And when I was sitting here,
all depressed,

253
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,103
I got a message from a colleague.

254
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:16,288
He asked if I wanted to run
a convenience store in my neighborhood.

255
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:19,266
And that was this place.

256
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:22,739
That's who I am.

257
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:27,950
I always know in advance
where I belong, like a psychic.

258
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,258
Sir.

259
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:35,188
Then go sit in some chairman's office
of a big company tomorrow.

260
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,041
Tell them that's where you belong.

261
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,695
Tell them you just know it.

262
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,928
Instead of going to Gyeongbokgung Palace.

263
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:45,650
Why do you keep going to the palace
where there's no chance?

264
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,677
Your last name isn't even Yi.

265
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,778
Take care.

266
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:41,397
Where's Gi-jeong?

267
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,464
She says she's busy.

268
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,717
I think I know why she's upset.

269
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:51,446
Me too.

270
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:56,615
All rise.

271
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,089
We'll sing hymn number 38.

272
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:08,691
I took a day off
to attend the kid's graduation ceremony.

273
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:11,462
But she asked me why
since I won't even be in the photos.

274
00:28:11,545 --> 00:28:14,812
She said someone like me
shouldn't be in a picture with her

275
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,011
on her graduation day,

276
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,576
since if someone asks,
"Who's this lady?" one day,

277
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:21,139
then she'll have to say,
"Someone my dad used to date."

278
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:24,365
I mean, how could she say that?
When I'm right there with them.

279
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:26,598
Did I say anything wrong?

280
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,120
Tell her to know her place.

281
00:28:29,989 --> 00:28:33,298
Only your family
should come to your graduation.

282
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:36,110
Why would she be there
when you're just dating?

283
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:39,501
But they're not just dating.

284
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,072
They're going to get married.

285
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:44,919
Then she should join when they're married.
Who knows what will happen?

286
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,336
She still shouldn't have
suddenly looked at her phone

287
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,569
and left saying, "I forgot I had plans."

288
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:55,340
She was obviously lying

289
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:57,532
and showing that she was upset.

290
00:28:57,614 --> 00:28:58,938
That was so immature.

291
00:29:00,178 --> 00:29:01,750
And that wasn't the first time.

292
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:06,505
When I raised my voice a bit,
she said she forgot she had other plans.

293
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,235
Why does she forget about her plans
every time?

294
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:12,544
She should make up
different excuses, at least.

295
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,727
She always has to show that she's upset.

296
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:18,705
Is she supposed to argue with you then?

297
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,709
Father's looking.

298
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:26,852
Today, even those who get angry
at their own siblings

299
00:29:26,935 --> 00:29:30,409
or call them idiots or dummies…

300
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:34,503
Just get married already
without worrying about me.

301
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:38,597
Spit out your gum.

302
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:42,030
Lastly, we will end the Mass

303
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,842
-with the Prayer of Confession.
-My lord.

304
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:46,744
-I'm to blame,
-I'm to blame.

305
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,473
-I'm to blame. It is my fault.
-I'm to blame.

306
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,410
It's not the first time
you've treated her like that.

307
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,477
But you've never
apologized to her properly.

308
00:29:54,561 --> 00:29:57,289
Do you think I do it for no reason?
It's for Yu-rim's sake.

309
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:59,068
Stop using her as an excuse!

310
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:01,012
Or I'll move out with her.

311
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:05,271
What? So Yu-rim's all grown up now, huh?
Are you saying you don't need us anymore?

312
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,339
Seriously…

313
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:21,483
I'm sorry.

314
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,295
I got too upset.

315
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:28,223
What do you want for lunch?

316
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:42,905
It's puberty.

317
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:49,108
Chang-hee just came back
and had lunch with us.

318
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,175
Yes.

319
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:54,360
Mr. Gu visited.

320
00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,461
<i>I…</i>

321
00:30:57,544 --> 00:30:59,364
gave him your number.

322
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,887
Did he call you yet?

323
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,402
We met up.

324
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:11,026
I see. That's good.

325
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,417
Take care. Bye.

326
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,402
Okay, take care, Dad.

327
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,034
Who did you meet?

328
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:05,325
CARD ISSUING OFFICE
NO PHONES OR CAMERAS

329
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,394
It's like a blank check

330
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:32,330
since the card
has the customer's personal information.

331
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:35,969
So, the security tends to be tight here,
even within the company.

332
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:39,071
Even one misprint, and you'll require
authorization to discard it.

333
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:43,041
About ten million cards are issued a year.

334
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:48,211
Everyone owns more than one card, right?
And they need another one if they lose it.

335
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,270
And there are about a thousand
different kinds of cards.

336
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:56,936
Once a card is launched,
it's almost impossible to end the service.

337
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,790
Since there are cards
organizations have used for a long time.

338
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:03,554
And the VIP cards
are handcrafted one by one.

339
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:10,666
A lot of work for the VIP department, too?

340
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:11,866
Yes, it's Monday.

341
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:21,460
Mi-jeong.

342
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:28,986
Let's go.

343
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,095
You look like you belong in Yeouido.

344
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:33,701
Wherever you are,
you always look like you belong there.

345
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:35,686
Even in Gangnam.

346
00:33:36,637 --> 00:33:39,656
I also look like
someone from Sanpo when I'm there.

347
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:42,634
You live in Gangbuk now, though.

348
00:33:43,998 --> 00:33:46,562
But it doesn't
feel like my neighborhood yet.

349
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,875
Compared to the workload,
the salary isn't as high,

350
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:57,646
but it's better than working at Joy Card.

351
00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:00,499
They also don't treat permanent
and temp workers differently.

352
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:04,883
If I started my career at this company,
I'd be an assistant manager by now.

353
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,060
I shouldn't have wasted my time
at Joy Card.

354
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:13,112
Did you hear Han Su-jin left?

355
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,504
I checked the job title chart,
and Han Su-jin was gone.

356
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,068
Why would you check that?

357
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:22,500
I always check
where those people have gone to work.

358
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,643
It's ecstatic to know
I don't have to work with them.

359
00:34:25,726 --> 00:34:27,628
"Yes, she has finally disappeared."

360
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:31,475
We've beat them, Mi-jeong.

361
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:35,361
I'm not even in the design field anymore.

362
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,636
But you're not staying there forever.

363
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:39,497
I'll stay.

364
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,772
What? Don't waste your talent.

365
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:44,129
It's a talent that only you recognize.

366
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:48,926
Be honest with me. Are you really
not aware how good you are?

367
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:54,757
Before, if I worked on the design
all night and submitted it

368
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,148
and they rejected it, I would think,
"What did I work all night for?"

369
00:34:58,934 --> 00:35:01,581
Even if I thought I did a good job,
if they said no,

370
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,310
all the work I did
would go down the drain.

371
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:06,833
But it's different here.

372
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:09,769
It really feels like I'm working.

373
00:35:10,348 --> 00:35:13,698
I think I'm better suited for jobs
that require precision over creativity.

374
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:17,585
Give your skills to me,
if you're not going to use them.

375
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:20,562
Take them.

376
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:25,567
I used to feel bad for her
since she was very quiet and looked sad.

377
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,296
How could she turn into a delinquent,
all of a sudden?

378
00:35:28,379 --> 00:35:30,901
You get farsighted
before you know it as you age.

379
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:33,093
She became a delinquent just like that.

380
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:35,905
I get scared and stutter when she talks.

381
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,951
I'm not confident
I could live with a kid like that.

382
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:45,748
But I can't leave her with her aunties
and live with Tae-hun alone.

383
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:47,402
My conscience won't let me.

384
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,083
We agreed to get married
when she turns 20.

385
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,357
But when she's 20,

386
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:57,451
I'll be 50, damn it.

387
00:35:58,568 --> 00:35:59,395
Hey.

388
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:01,629
Didn't we reach 40 so fast?

389
00:36:03,986 --> 00:36:05,433
Wouldn't 50 come fast, too?

390
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:08,576
It can't! Hey, 50 shouldn't come so fast.

391
00:36:08,659 --> 00:36:10,851
But you said you'd marry Tae-hun at 50.

392
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,174
I know, but…

393
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:17,054
It shouldn't come too soon,
but I hope it does at the same time.

394
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:21,769
Age 50…

395
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:28,303
Do you think you'll
even have any emotions when you're 50?

396
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:31,197
Won't it just be like
being an animal at that age?

397
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,118
Living just because you are alive
and eating fodder, right?

398
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:08,210
As a 50-year-old lady who's living
just because I'm alive and eating fodder,

399
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:12,470
I'll tell you something.

400
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:18,632
I understand why you think that way.

401
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,865
I really do.

402
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,316
I thought I would be so cool
when I turned 30,

403
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:29,384
but it didn't turn out that way.

404
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,553
And I thought,
"How will I live in my 40s?"

405
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,001
"And my 50s?"

406
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:39,888
-"What's the point of living?"
-We should just die.

407
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,956
"I should just die then."

408
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,279
But…

409
00:37:44,148 --> 00:37:45,141
at age 50?

410
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:47,332
It's just the same.

411
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:52,088
You become 50 years old
before you realize it.

412
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,968
I feel like I took a short nap

413
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,821
one day when I was 13

414
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:02,757
and just woke up.

415
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,652
Don't you feel the same?

416
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,058
Twelve for me.

417
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,878
You always try to count one year less.

418
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,731
-What about you?
-Hey, let's go.

419
00:38:12,434 --> 00:38:14,461
-Where?
-Home.

420
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,251
Hey, drink.

421
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:26,827
You'll probably feel the same
as me at 80, too, I bet.

422
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:31,500
Hey, bottoms up.

423
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:45,146
<i>INWANGJESAEKDO</i> BY JEONG SEON
216TH NATIONAL TREASURE

424
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:48,579
When I saw
ink paintings in art books in school,

425
00:38:49,158 --> 00:38:51,598
I'd wonder, "Is this China? North Korea?"

426
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,865
I've never seen mountains like these.

427
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:57,801
All the paintings from
the Joseon era are of rocky mountains.

428
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:00,986
When I moved here, I realized,

429
00:39:01,068 --> 00:39:02,888
"So this is where they were."

430
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:07,520
"Jeong Seon just painted
what was in his back garden at the time."

431
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,614
The mountains of Gyeonggi were green
and covered in scrub.

432
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:14,674
Weirdly, these rocky mountains
can only be found in Gangbuk.

433
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:16,866
Not south of the Han River.

434
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:25,426
I was really surprised while taking a walk
around Gyeongbokgung Palace.

435
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:27,949
You can pass through four neighborhoods
in ten minutes.

436
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:31,547
I was wondering why the neighborhoods
were divided up so small,

437
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:36,054
and it turns out they didn't divide them
by area, but by population,

438
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:39,942
and the population density there
during the Joseon era was extremely high.

439
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,375
Have you ever heard of Palpan-dong?

440
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,352
It's a neighborhood
behind Gyeongbokgung Palace.

441
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:49,950
During the Joseon era, they say that
eight ministers lived in that area alone.

442
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,439
So it was called "Palpan-dong."

443
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,969
Do you have an exam?

444
00:39:58,304 --> 00:39:59,834
What are you studying so hard for?

445
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:02,812
I'm a Seoul man now.

446
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:05,416
Sir.

447
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,270
People from Seoul
don't know any of that stuff.

448
00:40:09,304 --> 00:40:13,026
Also, your family must live in Seoul for
three generations to be really from Seoul.

449
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:14,928
Says who?

450
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:17,824
That professor who studies Seoul.

451
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,289
If you live in Seoul, you're a Seoul man.
Three generations, my ass.

452
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,143
Are you a Seoul man?

453
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:28,617
Of course. We've been living
in this neighborhood since my grandpa.

454
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:30,809
Good for you.

455
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,301
Then I guess my grandson
will be a Seoul man.

456
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:39,701
But you won't get married.

457
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:44,167
Didn't you say
it was over between you two?

458
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:49,005
She was pretty.

459
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,539
Do you ever miss Seon-u?

460
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,220
Well, sometimes?

461
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,529
I'd be very lonely

462
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:06,002
if the person I'd lived
with for seven years was gone.

463
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:10,220
It is lonely, but there are
many improvements too.

464
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:12,247
For starters,

465
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,687
no in-laws.

466
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,299
That's good.

467
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:18,078
That'd mean no more Cho Gyeong-seon.

468
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:20,848
Now that I'm on my own,

469
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:27,424
I feel sorry for pitying my friends who
weren't married and living alone before.

470
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,484
I realized I was arrogant.

471
00:41:30,567 --> 00:41:34,867
Even if you live alone, it's fine.
You can be perfectly happy.

472
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:39,624
You can eat whatever you want,
whenever you want,

473
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,146
and sleep whenever you want.

474
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,760
Eating and sleeping…

475
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:49,260
I had no idea that doing these simple
things however I want was such a joy.

476
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:55,463
Even if I don't clean for a week,
things stay where I left them.

477
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:58,275
-Hey.
-Yes?

478
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:01,128
The thing you liked
about being married before

479
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:04,892
was having someone to go
and eat <i>tteokbokki</i> with at 2 a.m.

480
00:42:04,974 --> 00:42:06,628
When I heard that, I thought,

481
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:09,813
"I see. That sounds nice."

482
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:11,550
You have no idea how jealous I was.

483
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:17,050
Do you think I'd get a craving
for <i>tteokbokki</i> at 2 a.m. every day?

484
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:22,550
After being single again, I realized

485
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,968
what a difficult life I'd been living
all this time, like a wheel going round.

486
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,111
Having to go to my in-laws' house
when the time came.

487
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:34,874
There were so many people
I had to have meals with.

488
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:41,202
No matter how you look at it,
life as a human,

489
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:44,510
whether it's married life or work life,

490
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,487
is about putting in the effort
to get on with others.

491
00:42:48,977 --> 00:42:52,781
Now that my husband is gone,
I've let it all go.

492
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,138
"It's fine."

493
00:42:55,883 --> 00:42:59,481
"I don't have to
try to get on with anyone."

494
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,617
"It's okay to live alone."

495
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:07,462
I didn't even get to try that yet.

496
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:11,267
-Gosh, it's so cold!
-Get off me.

497
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:12,839
PREGNANCY TEST

498
00:43:16,105 --> 00:43:17,222
What shall we get?

499
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:20,654
I want <i>gan jjambbong</i>.

500
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:21,647
Sure.

501
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,012
I want this one.

502
00:43:25,658 --> 00:43:26,485
What?

503
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:29,587
Did you just finish your academy?

504
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:37,113
Oh, this…

505
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:39,306
I'm not.

506
00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:42,242
If I buy one of these,
my period always starts.

507
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:44,806
So, I just end up wasting
my money every time.

508
00:43:46,419 --> 00:43:48,694
I'm not, I'm definitely not.

509
00:43:49,437 --> 00:43:50,389
Yu-rim.

510
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,882
That lady just put a pregnancy test
in her pocket.

511
00:43:57,377 --> 00:43:58,412
Who?

512
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:03,292
I'm going to pay for it. I am.

513
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:26,823
BOOK RETURNS

514
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,202
What brings you here, sir?

515
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:38,815
I was in the area for lunch.

516
00:44:41,338 --> 00:44:43,736
Why do you order so many new products?

517
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,846
You're helping Mr. Kim out too much.

518
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:47,955
Even if I could never make team leader,

519
00:44:48,038 --> 00:44:51,098
I'm going to make my branch manager
a team leader.

520
00:44:58,335 --> 00:44:59,163
I'm impressed.

521
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,008
You paid off that loan.

522
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,557
I would have just given up.

523
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:09,625
How did you hold out?

524
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,016
Well, it was do-or-die.

525
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:21,783
There was this guy I knew.

526
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:25,092
He used to stare
at the mountain every day.

527
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:29,476
He said there were 7.7 billion people
just like him on Earth,

528
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:34,438
but he didn't know
how much 7.7 billion was,

529
00:45:35,348 --> 00:45:39,856
so he said if you replaced each human
with a one-won coin,

530
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:43,164
a total of 7.7 billion 1-won coins…

531
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,623
would be piled up
to the size of that mountain.

532
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,943
I realized I was just a tiny one-won coin…

533
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:03,098
and there was no need
to make such a fuss through life.

534
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,398
Who said that?

535
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,756
Yu-rim said she saw it.

536
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:12,940
<i>If she says she's pregnant,</i>

537
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:16,290
don't beat around the bush,
and just ask her to marry you.

538
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:20,053
I think that's the right thing to do.

539
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:23,114
<i>Dragging things out like this
will only be hard on both of you,</i>

540
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:27,951
and Yu-rim will dote on the baby
once she sees it wriggling around.

541
00:46:31,342 --> 00:46:32,335
All right.

542
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,279
Okay. Bye.

543
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,434
SHALL WE GET DINNER TOGETHER TODAY?

544
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:57,314
<i>Sounds great!</i>

545
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:08,894
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO EAT?

546
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,013
<i>I want to eat everything!</i>

547
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,417
<i>They should have delivered the heater.</i>

548
00:47:33,996 --> 00:47:35,153
<i>It'll be at your door.</i>

549
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:41,274
<i>Your habit of leaving me on read
hasn't changed.</i>

550
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:28,336
SAFEGUARD HEATER

551
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:31,645
Unlike the others in this field,

552
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:35,946
you don't gamble, you don't chase women.

553
00:48:36,028 --> 00:48:39,378
You don't do anything else.
You just drink quietly by yourself.

554
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:42,604
I liked that, and that's why
I came this far with you.

555
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,325
But now, alcohol is the problem.

556
00:48:49,097 --> 00:48:53,812
I heard that you beat up one
of your managers recently over nothing.

557
00:48:55,134 --> 00:48:57,161
You're not as thorough as you used to be.

558
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:01,628
Do you really have no plans to stop?

559
00:49:02,827 --> 00:49:05,349
Don't tell me you're not an alcoholic.

560
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:12,338
If you don't have the willpower,
try taking medicine.

561
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:17,343
Try everything you can.

562
00:49:20,278 --> 00:49:22,181
Are you going to go down like this?

563
00:49:27,392 --> 00:49:30,162
I heard you told Baek's younger sister

564
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:34,711
to go to the hospital and get therapy.

565
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,922
Telling her about
some two-thirds point or something.

566
00:49:40,626 --> 00:49:41,659
What was it?

567
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,663
The point where it all becomes nothing.

568
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:49,972
Were those all empty words?

569
00:50:00,021 --> 00:50:01,096
I do see

570
00:50:02,709 --> 00:50:03,536
a doctor.

571
00:50:04,776 --> 00:50:06,472
They told me you don't come anymore.

572
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:08,416
I changed my doctor.

573
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:12,055
Dr. Kim was boring.

574
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:16,976
Is therapy supposed to be fun?

575
00:50:17,721 --> 00:50:20,202
I can't talk to a dull person
even for ten minutes.

576
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,766
What did you talk about?

577
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:29,921
He said I was always

578
00:50:31,244 --> 00:50:32,485
on guard.

579
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:38,646
Because I'm "one."

580
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,098
Watching out
for a knife or a bottle coming at me,

581
00:50:46,215 --> 00:50:48,241
or if someone pocketed any money.

582
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:50,640
I watch them,
catch them, and beat them up.

583
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:58,786
It's not like I have a partner
that I can share the workload with.

584
00:50:58,869 --> 00:51:00,028
I'm always alone.

585
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,508
One.

586
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:14,460
I try to be happy
for just five minutes a day.

587
00:51:16,735 --> 00:51:17,768
So I try to gather up

588
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:22,028
moments of excitement
in four and seven-second chunks,

589
00:51:24,592 --> 00:51:26,826
to fill five minutes a day.

590
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:32,532
But I haven't even been able
to gather one second today.

591
00:51:37,081 --> 00:51:38,777
Just now, while talking to you…

592
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:44,112
I got excited for three seconds.

593
00:51:49,984 --> 00:51:50,976
It's six seconds now.

594
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,146
It's quite long today.

595
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:05,616
Twelve times.

596
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:08,139
Your nickname is now "Twelve Times."

597
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:10,497
You change your mind twelve times a day.

598
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,106
Don't underestimate me.
It's a million times.

599
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:29,269
Do you want a part-time job?

600
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,735
What kind of part-time job?

601
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:39,524
Cleaning?

602
00:52:41,716 --> 00:52:42,667
No.

603
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:44,901
Then what?

604
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,449
Listening to me talk.

605
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:56,563
When I…

606
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,830
started out as a host,

607
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:05,041
I quit after just two weeks, thinking,
"There's no way I can do this."

608
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,853
All people do is complain.

609
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:11,120
"My husband is having an affair,"
and so on.

610
00:53:14,015 --> 00:53:18,937
I would rather go and get beaten up
until my nose bleeds than do this.

611
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,477
You should get paid
to listen to someone else talking.

612
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:33,204
How about ten sessions?

613
00:53:37,091 --> 00:53:39,241
You usually get therapy
in sets of ten sessions.

614
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,053
After the ten sessions,

615
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:47,141
if I still have things to say,

616
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,587
we'll do another ten sessions.

617
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:54,915
You like listening to me talk.

618
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:00,994
You're putting words in my mouth now.

619
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:15,510
She became a widow
after seven years of marriage.

620
00:54:15,593 --> 00:54:16,420
But…

621
00:54:17,164 --> 00:54:18,570
while they were married,

622
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,333
she says half her brain was
always thinking about preparing food.

623
00:54:22,416 --> 00:54:24,070
"What do we have in the fridge?"

624
00:54:24,154 --> 00:54:27,296
"We need to eat the vegetables
before they go bad. The fish!"

625
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:31,515
I know what she means.

626
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:35,361
After Mom passed,
I always thought, "Feed Dad!"

627
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:40,158
Exhausted after working overtime,
I'd be on my way home sleepily,

628
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,722
and remember, "Right, I didn't get flour."

629
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:49,628
Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

630
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,076
You already ate a big dinner.

631
00:54:52,234 --> 00:54:54,053
Weirdly, for me, with fruit,

632
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:56,534
I have to fill up my whole mouth
for it to taste good.

633
00:54:56,617 --> 00:54:58,313
Like when you drink juice.

634
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:02,365
You know? With fruit juice,
you have to fill your whole mouth.

635
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:09,561
And, I feel like I eat more on that day.

636
00:55:12,911 --> 00:55:16,302
When it starts, I get cravings.
Everything is so delicious.

637
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:20,355
Before period, everything's annoying.
I want to knock everything down.

638
00:55:20,438 --> 00:55:23,250
But as soon as it starts,
all of that goes away.

639
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:25,814
I'm like, "When was I depressed?"

640
00:55:28,998 --> 00:55:30,238
You're on your period.

641
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:34,498
Thank goodness. I thought…

642
00:55:42,521 --> 00:55:44,465
You thought I was pregnant.

643
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:48,808
No, I'm not!

644
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:54,803
Thank goodness for that.

645
00:55:56,706 --> 00:55:57,575
Come on!

646
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:12,503
Well…

647
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:14,613
I'm sorry.

648
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:16,763
I made a mistake.

649
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:24,703
Don't worry about it.

650
00:56:29,542 --> 00:56:31,940
I'm really sorry.

651
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:04,198
When I met you again,

652
00:57:08,787 --> 00:57:09,739
I regretted it.

653
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:12,717
"Crazy bastard."

654
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:15,074
"What are you thinking?"

655
00:57:19,954 --> 00:57:23,014
{\an8}"I think I ended things with her
in Sanpo pretty well."

656
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,818
{\an8}"I'm sure I wasn't that awful to her."

657
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:29,920
{\an8}"I should've left it at that."

658
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:41,914
{\an8}Yeom Mi-jeong!

659
00:57:45,387 --> 00:57:46,463
{\an8}You startled me.

660
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,624
{\an8}Just know this.

661
00:57:55,478 --> 00:57:57,421
{\an8}I liked you for real.

662
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:04,494
{\an8}Later…

663
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,704
{\an8}I have no idea
what kind of mess I might become.

664
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:13,550
{\an8}I'll probably end up homeless.

665
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:20,001
{\an8}I'll be grateful if I could
end things before then.

666
00:58:24,882 --> 00:58:26,825
{\an8}Anyway, I really liked you.

667
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,566
Thank you.

668
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,235
I really hate people.

669
00:58:46,469 --> 00:58:48,992
I hate seeing them
moving around in front of me.

670
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:54,947
If my temper suddenly flares, I don't know
what kind of expression I might show you,

671
00:58:55,029 --> 00:58:58,172
what I might do,
or what I might say to you.

672
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:01,232
I'm scared.

673
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,507
But…

674
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:07,271
remember this one thing.

675
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:16,245
Even if I end up becoming the asshole
to end all assholes later on,

676
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,760
remember I really liked you.

677
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:28,816
I want to record it.

678
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:32,249
Record it.

679
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:35,557
Do it.

680
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:44,821
Yeom Mi-jeong! I really liked you!

681
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:48,667
Yeom Mi-jeong.

682
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:02,645
After the ten sessions,
if I still have things to say,

683
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:04,299
we'll do another ten sessions.

684
01:00:06,161 --> 01:00:08,021
And after we extend our sessions,

685
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:11,205
we'll end it there

686
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:16,416
if I have nothing more to say.

687
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:20,510
Let's…

688
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:24,026
end it then.

689
01:00:30,146 --> 01:00:31,056
All right.

690
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,951
How's Chang-hee doing?

691
01:00:58,681 --> 01:01:00,914
I finished repaying my loan yesterday.

692
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,208
You've worked hard.

693
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,535
I'll head down to see you next weekend.

694
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:14,603
You're busy, there's no need.

695
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:16,630
It's fine. Don't come.

696
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:20,310
Don't skip your meals.

697
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:25,190
Talk soon. Okay.

698
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:41,607
I'll be back.

699
01:02:34,956 --> 01:02:37,230
{\an8}<i>Do you want to break me down?</i>

700
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:41,779
{\an8}You have to be with someone who's broken
to feel alive and needed,

701
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:44,591
{\an8}but you must be bored to death
since I'm doing just fine.

702
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:46,453
{\an8}-That's not true!
-Yes, it is!

703
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:50,505
{\an8}I need to be sick and dying like Hyeok-su
for you to passionately care for me,

704
01:02:50,588 --> 01:02:54,558
{\an8}but I'm too healthy and working too hard,
so you're so bored.

705
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:56,088
{\an8}Because I'm diligent and normal!

706
01:03:04,525 --> 01:03:06,096
{\an8}With the convenience store,

707
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:08,949
{\an8}I just started feeling like I can get by.

708
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:11,845
{\an8}I'm not crawling back into that hell
just for your enjoyment.

709
01:03:12,548 --> 01:03:16,890
{\an8}I'm not going stand being looked down on
and feeling like a piece of shit.

710
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,495
{\an8}Nor am I going to be terminally ill.
Never!

711
01:03:21,439 --> 01:03:23,383
{\an8}I'm going to keep living a normal life.

712
01:03:25,161 --> 01:03:26,112
{\an8}So just leave.

713
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:40,628
If things get too tough for you,

714
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:42,778
come back.

715
01:03:43,523 --> 01:03:44,929
If I'm still alone,

716
01:03:45,673 --> 01:03:46,665
I'll be here for you.

717
01:03:48,155 --> 01:03:49,313
And after a while,

718
01:03:50,925 --> 01:03:52,786
if you want to leave again,

719
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:55,392
then leave again.

720
01:03:58,617 --> 01:03:59,651
It's all right.

721
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:02,091
This time,

722
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:05,772
let's part ways
with blessings for each other.

723
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:09,287
What blessings? Do you go to church?

724
01:04:10,899 --> 01:04:11,892
Hyeon-a.

725
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,284
Ji Hyeon-a.

726
01:04:18,178 --> 01:04:19,254
It's all right.

727
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,231
I hold nothing against you.

728
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,160
I've always known
what kind of a person you are,

729
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,675
and I'm not mad that I didn't get things
the way that I wanted,

730
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,355
so you don't have to be sorry
that you couldn't keep up.

731
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:35,630
I mean it.

732
01:04:37,697 --> 01:04:39,228
I really hold nothing against you.

733
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,089
Really.

734
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,239
I wish that you were happy.

735
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:47,168
Let's both

736
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:52,585
bless each other
without any hatred in our hearts…

737
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,391
and end things here.

738
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:19,514
<i>Gu.</i>

739
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:25,635
<i>I don't think I was a one-won coin.</i>

740
01:06:27,372 --> 01:06:29,274
<i>I think I've been that mountain all along.</i>

741
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:32,582
<i>I think I'll return to that mountain.</i>

742

MY LIBERATION NOTES

744
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:10,753
<i>I like it when you shout, "Yeom Mi-jeong!"</i>

745
01:07:10,835 --> 01:07:11,911
<i>Yeom Mi-jeong!</i>

746
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:16,377
But I was determined
from the moment I met you.

747
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,901
And he asked me if he could see
the liberation notes.

748
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:20,844
<i>Are we going to be authors, then?</i>

749
01:07:21,919 --> 01:07:26,426
<i>Love is supposed to give you strength,
but will I be happy if we broke up?</i>

750
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,619
You know the test is at our store, right?

751
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:31,141
<i>I thought I had finally
made a breakthrough in life.</i>

752
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:33,126
<i>Spring must be on its way.</i>

753
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:36,311
I'm sure he's pocketed
a lot of money all this time.

754
01:07:36,393 --> 01:07:37,799
<i>Let's end it with him.</i>

755
01:07:38,461 --> 01:07:40,570
<i>"I'm definitely not happy."</i>

756
01:07:41,108 --> 01:07:42,845
<i>"So please punish me just a little."</i>

757
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,830
<i>"Please."</i>
